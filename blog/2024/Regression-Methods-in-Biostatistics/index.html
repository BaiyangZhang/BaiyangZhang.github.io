For example, which drug should a doctor prescribe to treat an illness? What factors increase the risk of an individual developing coronary heart attack? To answer these questions (even remotely), we need <em>objective, evidence-based</em> decision making method.</p> <p><strong>Evidence-based practice:</strong> Using sound research findings based on observed or collected data to make decisions.</p> <p>In principle, people collect and process information every day of their lives. Since it’s something we do frequently, you might think we would be really good at it…but we’re not. We are not good at picking out patterns from a sea of noisy data. And, on the flip side, we are too good at picking out non-existent patterns from small numbers of observations.</p> <p>In order to mitigate any of our own personal biases when answering important questions about the way the world works (i.e., to do good science), we must be careful to be rigorous in the way we proceed. The <strong>scientific method</strong> is the process used to answer scientific questions.</p> <ol> <li>Ask the question</li> <li>Construct a hypothesis</li> <li>Test it with a study or an experiment</li> <li>Analyze data and draw conclusions (wish its as simple as that)</li> <li>Communicate results</li> </ol> <p>However, collecting and analyzing data can be complicated. Statistics helps us design studies, test hypotheses, and use data to make scientifically valid conclusions about the world. In general, scientists use the scientific method to make generalizations about classes of people on the basis of their studies. The class of people that they are trying to make generalizations about is called the <strong>population</strong>. Most of the time, it is impractical and expensive to study all individuals in a population, Instead of sampling everyone in the population, or taking a <strong>census</strong>, typically we study only a portion of the population called the <strong>sample</strong>. In order to determine how best to obtain a sample to answer the research questions, we must be cautious about the study design. Then, researchers make <strong>generalizations</strong>, or <strong>inference</strong>, about the entire population based on studying the sample.</p> <p>In this note we consider two broad categories of statistical analysis: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">descriptive statistics</code>, which deals with methods for summarizing and/or presenting data and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inferential statistics</code>.</p> <p><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong>: Methods for summarizing and/or presenting data. <strong>Inferential statistics</strong>: Methods for making generalizations about a population using information contained in the sample.</p> <hr> <p>It is difficult to sort through large streams of data and make any meaningful conclusions. Instead, we can better understand data by condensing it into human readable mediums through the use of data <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">summaries</code>, often displayed in the forms of tables and figures. However, in doing so, information is often be lost in the process. A good data summary will seek to strike a balance between clarity and completeness of information.</p> <p>There are two broad types of data that we may see in the wild, which we will call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">categorical data</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continuous data</code>. As the name suggests, categorical data (sometimes called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">qualitative</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">discrete</code> data) are <em>data that fall into distinct categories</em>. Categorical data can further be classified into two distinct types:</p> <ul> <li>Nominal data: data that exists without any sort of natural or apparent ordering, e.g., colors (red, green, blue), gender (male, female), and type of motor vehicle (car, truck, SUV).</li> <li>Ordinal data: data that does have a natural ordering, e.g., education (high school, some college, college) and injury severity (low, medium, high).</li> </ul> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Continuous data</code> (sometimes called quantitative data), on the other hand, are data that can take on any numeric value on some interval or on a continuum. Examples of continuous data include height, weight, and temperature. Categorical and continuous data are summarized differently, and we’ll explore a number of ways to summarize both types of data.</p> <p>Below are some terminologies.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Absolute frequency</code>: The number of observations in a category <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rate/Relative frequency</code>: The number of observations in a category relative to any other quantity <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Percent/Proportion</code>: The number of observations per 100 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bar plot</code>: Visualization of categorical data which uses bars to represent each category, with counts or percents represented by the height of each bar <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Stratification</code>: The process of partitioning data into categories prior to summarizing</p> <hr> <p>The two most common ways to describe the center are with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mean</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">median</code>. We all know what the mean is. The median is another common <em>measure of the center of a distribution</em>. In particular, for a set of observations, <em>the median is an observed value that is both larger than half of the observations, as well as smaller than half of the observations</em>.</p> <p>Sometimes there lies some data that are extremely different than the rest. Take the salaries of staff of some American university, the highest paid employee is usually the football coach, and much much higher then the rest. This one high salary, which is not representative of most of the salaries collected, is known as an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outlier</code>. In this particular case, the mean is highly sensitive to the presence of outliers while the <em>median is not</em>. Measures that are less sensitive to outliers are called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">robust</code> measures. The median is a robust estimator of the center of the data.</p> <p>The shape of a distribution is often characterized by its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modality</code> and its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skew</code>. The modality of a distribution <em>is a statement about its modes, or “peaks.”</em> Distributions with a single peak are called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unimodal</code>, whereas distributions with two peaks are call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bimodal</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Multimodal</code> distributions are those with three or more peaks. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skew</code> on the other hand describes <em>how our data relates to those peaks</em>. Distributions in which the data is dispersed evenly on either side of a peak are called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">symmetric distributions</code>; otherwise, the distribution is considered skewed. The direction of the skew is towards the side in which the tail is longest.</p> <hr> <p>In addition to measuring the center of the distribution, we are also interested in the spread or dispersion of the data. Two distributions could have the same mean or median without necessarily having the same shape. Perhaps the most intuitive methods of describing the dispersion of our data are those associated with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">percentile-based</code> summaries. Formally, the $p$-th percentile is some value $V_ {p}$ such that</p> <ol> <li>$p\%$ of observations are $\leq V_ {p}$;</li> <li>$1-p\%$ of observations are $\gg V_ {p}$.</li> </ol> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quartile</code> is made of</p> \[\begin{align*} Q_ {1} &amp;= 25\text{th} \text{ percentile} = 1\text{st} \text{ or lower quartile}\\ Q_ {2} &amp;= 50\text{th} \text{ percentile} = 2\text{nd} \text{ quartile or median}\\ Q_ {3} &amp;= 75\text{th} \text{ percentile} = 3\text{rd} \text{ or upper quartile}\\ \end{align*}\] <p>A commonly used percentile-based measure of spread combining these measures is the <strong>interquartile range (IQR)</strong>, defined as</p> <p>\(\text{IQR} := Q_ {3} - Q_ {1}.\) The IQR is not impacted by the presence of outliers, so it is considered a robust measure of the spread of the data. So, like the median, it enjoys the quality of being a robust measure of the data.</p> <p>Percentiles are also used to create another common visual representation of continuous data: the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">boxplot</code>, also known as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">box-and-whisker plot</code>. A boxplot consist of the following elements:</p> <ul> <li>A box, indicating the Interquartile Range (IQR), bounded by the values $Q_ {1}$ and $Q_ {3}$;</li> <li>The median, or $Q_ {2}$, represented by the line drawn within the box;</li> <li>The “whiskers,” extending out of the box, which can be defined in a number of ways. Commonly, the whiskers are 1.5 times the length of the IQR from either $Q_ {1}$ or $Q_ {3}$;</li> <li>Outliers, presented as small circles or dots, and are values in the data that are not present within the bounds set by either the box or whiskers.</li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/img/boxPlot-480.webp 480w,/img/boxPlot-800.webp 800w,/img/boxPlot-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/img/boxPlot.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Just like histograms, boxplots can also illustrate the skew of a data. In a histogram, the skewed was named after the location of the tail and in a boxplot, this corresponds to the side with a longer whisker. Here we can see histograms and boxplots for various distributions of data. </div> <hr> <p>The variance and the standard deviation are numerical summaries which quantify how spread out the distribution is around its mean.</p> <p>We have two kinds of variances: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sample variance</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">population variance</code>. The difference between sample variance and population variance lies in how they are calculated and what they represent in the context of statistical analysis.</p> <p><strong>Population Variance</strong>:</p> <p>Population variance measures how much the members of a population differ from the population mean. It is denoted by $\sigma^2$. If you have a population with $N$ members and population values $x_1, x_2, …, x_N$, the population variance $\sigma^2$ is calculated as: \(\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2\) where $\mu$ is the population mean. Note that $\mu$ is not the mean of some measured data, it is supposed to be given by some theoretical model. Population variance is used when you have access to all the data points in the population.</p> <p><strong>Sample Variance</strong></p> <p>Sample variance measures how much the members of a sample (a subset of the population) differ from the sample mean. It is an estimator of the population variance. Sample variance is denoted by $s^2$. If you have a sample of size $n$ with values $x_1, x_2, …, x_n$, the sample variance $s^2$ is calculated as: \(s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \overline{x})^2\) where $\overline{x}$ is the sample mean.</p> <p>Key Differences:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Purpose:</strong> Population variance describes the variability within an entire population, while sample variance estimates the population variance from a subset of the population.</li> <li> <strong>Formula:</strong> The population variance formula divides by $n$ (the total number of population members), whereas the sample variance formula divides by $n-1$ (one less than the sample size).</li> <li> <strong>Bias Correction:</strong> The use of $n-1$ in the sample variance formula, known as Bessel’s correction, corrects for the bias in the estimation of population variance from a sample.</li> </ol> <p>When we calculate the variance of a sample, we typically use the sample mean $\overline{x}$ as an estimate of the true population mean. However, using the sample mean introduces a bias because it is based on the same data points that we are using to calculate the variance. This means the sum of the squared deviations $(x_i - \overline{x})^2$ tends to be smaller than it would be if we used the true population mean, leading to an underestimate of the true population variance.</p> <p>To correct for this bias, we use $n-1$ in the denominator instead of $n$. This adjustment is known as Bessel’s correction. The rationale behind it is that when estimating variance from a sample, we lose one degree of freedom because we have estimated the mean from the same data set. Using $n-1$ effectively compensates for this loss, making the sample variance an unbiased estimator of the true population variance.</p> <p>In summary, the factor $\frac{1}{n-1}$ is used instead of $\frac{1}{n}$ to make the sample variance an unbiased estimator of the population variance, accounting for the fact that the sample mean is used in the variance calculation.</p> <p>The standard deviation, denoted as $s$, is a function of variance. Recall that the mean is not a robust outlier and is highly sensitive to skew or the presence of outliers. Consequently, the variance and the standard deviation are also very sensitive.</p> <hr> <p>The regression method is a statistical technique used to model and analyze the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The primary goal of regression is to predict the value of the dependent (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">response</code>) variable based on the values of the independent (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">predictor</code>) variables. It is widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, biological sciences, and social sciences for forecasting, estimating, and determining causal relationships.</p> <p>There are several types of regression methods, each suited to different types of data and relationships:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Linear Regression</strong>: The simplest form of regression, linear regression uses a linear approach to model the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The model assumes that the relationship can be described by a straight line in the form $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \epsilon$, where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x_1$ is the independent variable, $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept, $\beta_1$ is the slope of the line, and $\epsilon$ represents the error term.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Multiple Linear Regression</strong>: An extension of simple linear regression, this method involves two or more independent variables. The model is expressed as $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + … + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon$, where $x_1, x_2, …, x_n$ are the independent variables.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Logistic Regression</strong>: Used when the dependent variable is categorical, typically binary. Logistic regression models the probability that the dependent variable belongs to a particular category, using a logistic function.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Polynomial Regression</strong>: A form of regression where the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ridge and Lasso Regression</strong>: These are types of linear regression that include regularization. Regularization adds a penalty on the size of coefficients to prevent overfitting. Ridge regression adds a squared magnitude of the coefficient as a penalty term to the loss function, while Lasso regression adds the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficient as a penalty term.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Non-linear Regression</strong>: Used when the data cannot be modeled using linear methods due to a non-linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. Non-linear regression can fit complex curves to data.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Regression analysis involves selecting the appropriate model for the data, estimating the model parameters (usually through methods like least squares), evaluating the model’s adequacy (checking for goodness-of-fit, residuals, etc.), and interpreting the results to make inferences or predictions.</p> <p>In practice, the choice of regression method depends on the nature of the dependent variable, the shape of the relationship, and the distribution of the residuals, among other factors. Proper model selection, diagnostic testing, and validation are crucial steps in ensuring that the regression model provides reliable and accurate predictions or insights.</p> <h1 id="multipredictor-regression">Multipredictor Regression</h1> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Excerpt-From-On-Anarchism/">Excerpt From "On Anarchism" by Noam Chomsky</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Domain-Wall/">Domain Wall</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Quantum-Kinks/">Kink in Quantum Field Theory, A Broad Outline</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Renormalization-method-in-PDF/">Renormalization method in PDF</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Baiyang Zhang.

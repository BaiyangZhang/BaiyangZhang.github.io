There are usually two kinds of quantum actions, one is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wilsonian quantum action</code>, where the higher momentum modes are integrated out to focus on the low-energy, long-distance behavior of a system. The Wilsonian effective potential is a way to understand the behavior of a physical system at different scales. Take a scalar field theory $\phi$ for example. The “integrating out” procedure is done using the path integral approach, it involves <em>separating the field into high and low energy parts</em>. We split the scalar field into $\phi = \phi_ {\text{low}} + \phi_ {\text{high}}$, where $\phi_ {\text{low}}$ contains modes below a certain energy scale $\Lambda$ and $\phi_ {\text{high}}$ contains modes above $\Lambda$. Then, the path integral over the full field is then re-written as a path integral over these two components. The crucial step is to integrate out the high-energy modes $\phi_ {\text{high}}$. This can be done perturbatively by treating $\phi_ {\text{high}}$ as a different field as $\phi_ {\text{low}}$, using Feynman diagram techniques. The resulting effective action should only depends on the low-energy modes. Then, the Wilsonian effective action captures the dynamics of the field <em>at energies below</em> $\Lambda$. It will typically have a form different from the original action, often with new interactions generated as a result of integrating out the high-energy modes.</p> <p>The other kind of effective action is the so-called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quantum effective actions</code> which is the Legendre transformation of the generating functional of connected diagrams, this is quite a mouthful and we will talk more about it in the next section. When the original action is replaced by the quantum effective action, the tree-level diagrams generated by it will contain <em>all the quantum corrections</em> of the full theory (i.e. the original theory). The quantum effective action has a useful property that it can give us the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the field operator with quantum correction. As we will see, the Coleman-Weinberg potential is a special case of the effective action.</p> <hr> <p>There are in general three ways to calculate the effective action as listed in the following.</p> <ul> <li>By matching, we require</li> </ul> \[\int \mathcal{D}\{\text{original dof}\} e^{iS} = \int \mathcal{D}\{\text{effective dof}\} e^{i\Gamma}\] <p>where dof stands for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">degree of freedom</code>, the LHS is the original theory while the RHS is the effective theory, with different degree of freedom, $\Gamma$ is the quantum action.</p> <ul> <li> <p>by Legendre transformation, as will be shown in the next section.</p> </li> <li> <p>by background field method, that is to separate the field into a static non-propagating background field $\phi_ b$ and a dynamic propagating field $\tilde{\phi}$, the dynamic fields are the fluctuations around the background field. Integrating out the fluctuations (usually done perturbatively) leaves us the effective potential $\Gamma[\phi_ b]$,</p> </li> </ul> \[\int \mathcal{D} \phi e^{i S[\phi_ b + \tilde{\phi}]} = e^{i\Gamma[\phi_ b]}.\] <p>Another approach to deriving an effective theory is through an educated guess. Given that the effective action must possess the same symmetries as the original action, one can propose various <em>local terms</em> that fulfill this requirement. The coefficients of these terms are then adjusted based on experimental data. This method relies on symmetry considerations to guide the formulation of potential terms in the effective action.</p> <p>For the rest of the note, we will confine our discussion to $\phi^4$ model with real scalar fields.</p> <h3 id="quantum-action">Quantum Action</h3> <p>The partition function (with source) reads \(Z[J] = \int \mathcal{D} \phi e^{iS[\phi] + i\int \phi J}\) where $S$ is the action, $J$ is the source, $\int \phi J$ is short for $\int dx^4 \phi(x) J(x)$. $\phi$ field is integrated out hence $Z$ is a functional of $J$ only.</p> <p>From it we can define the generating function $W[J]$ by \(Z[J] = e^{iW[J]} \implies W[J] = -i \ln Z[J],\) $W[J]$ is the summation of connected diagrams with source, refer to Mark Srednicki’s text book on quantum field theory. It generate <em>connected diagrams</em>, due to the exponential form of the path integral representation.</p> <p>The expectation value of $\phi$ in the presence of a source $J$ is given by</p> \[\left\langle {\phi}_ J \right\rangle=\frac{1}{Z} \int \mathcal{D} \phi e^{iS[\phi] + i\int \phi J} \phi = \frac{\delta W[J]}{\delta J(x)}\equiv \varphi,\] <p>Note the difference between $\phi$ and the so-called “varphi” $\varphi$, the former is a operator while the latter is a classical field. When compared to the classical mechanics of point particles, $W$ is similar to the Lagrangian $L$, $J$ to $\dot{q}$, and $\delta W / \delta J$ to $\partial L / \partial \dot{q}$ which define a new variable.</p> <p>The generating functional $W[J]$ is a functional of $J$, we can perform Legendre transformation to define a new functional in terms of $\delta W / \delta J =: \varphi$. Behold, the quantum action:</p> \[\boxed{ \Gamma[\varphi] = W[J] - \int J\varphi , }\] <p>which is indeed a functional of $\varphi$, and we have omitted the measure under the integral sign. We have</p> <p>\(\frac{\delta\Gamma}{\delta\varphi} = -J.\) <strong>Summary.</strong></p> <ul> <li>$\Gamma[\varphi]$ generates the 1-particle irreducible (1PI) diagrams;</li> <li>$W[J]$ generates connected diagrams;</li> <li>$Z[J]$ generates all kinds of diagrams.</li> </ul> <hr> <p>There are superficially two different ways to define the quantum effective action, 1) by requiring that the tree diagrams of the effective action reproduce the quantum effects of the original action, and 2) by Legendre transformation. It is not meant to be obvious, but they are equivalent to each other. To see it, we can first <strong>define</strong> $\Gamma[\phi]$ to be whose tree diagrams gives us all the quantum effects, then since $iW[J]$ also gives all the quantum effects with loops, we have</p> \[e^{iW[J]} = \lim_ {\hbar\to 0} \int \mathcal{D}\phi e^{i\Gamma[\phi]/\hbar}\] <p>where the limiting process isolates out the tree contribution, then use the fastest descent approximation we find $\Gamma$ can be written as the Legendre transformation of $W[J]$.</p> <p>To see that $\Gamma$ generates only the 1PI diagrams, recall that quantum effective action has the property that the tree-level graphs generated by it gives the complete scattering amplitude. Putting $\Gamma[\varphi]$ at the position of action $S$, we will have a new path integral \(Z_ \Gamma[J] = \int \mathcal{D}\phi e^{i\Gamma +i\int \phi J}.\) It will generate Feynman diagrams with sources, just like the original action $S$ does, only this time the tree diagrams alone is enough to give the complete information of the original theory. Thus $\Gamma$ must gives us exact propagators and exact n-point vertices, while the original action $S$ gives us the ordinary propagator and ordinary vertex. Also in order to calculate the exact n-point vertex, we need not consider the 1-particle reducible diagrams since any contribution from connected diagram can be written as a tree diagram comprised of two or more sub 1 particle IRREDUCIBLE diagrams.</p> <p><strong>Remark.</strong> The generating functionals such as $W[J]$ and $\Gamma[\varphi]$ are classical. In fact the language of path integral has a feeling of classical field theory, in the sense that each path we take into consideration is a c-field in space-time, instead of q-field.</p> <h4 id="tree-level-example">Tree-level Example</h4> <p>In the classical limit, taking the limit $\hbar \to 0$, the partition function become \(Z = \int \mathcal{D}\phi e^{iS + i\int \phi J}\) which receives dominant contribution from the stationary configuration, given by \(\frac{\delta}{\delta\phi}\left( S + \int \phi J \right) = 0 \implies \frac{\delta S}{\delta\phi} = - J\) which has a solution $\varphi$. Thus the partition function is \(Z = e^{iS+i\int \varphi J}\) up to a normalization factor. Since \(W[J] = -i \ln Z = S + \int \varphi J,\) we have \(\varphi = \frac{\delta W}{\delta J} = \left\langle {\phi}_ J \right\rangle\) thus \(\Gamma[\varphi] = W - \int \varphi J = S[\varphi].\) At the tree-level, the quantum effective action and the original action are the same.</p> <h3 id="effective-potential">Effective Potential</h3> <p>In the classical dynamics, the vacuum (lowest energy state) configuration of the system is given by the minimum of the potential. In the quantum theory, we are sometimes interested in the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the field operator $\phi$. In a quantum field theory, there is also have a potential term whose minimum gives the classical vacuum field configuration, however that’s not the full story, since in a quantum theory the field always fluctuates around the vacuum, giving rise to a correction to $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle$.</p> <p>We want a quantum effective potential which works like the classical potential, in the sense that its minimum corresponds to the field configuration of the vacuum, quantum corrections included. Luckily we already have something like that, i.e. the quantum effective action.</p> <p>Recall that the quantum effective action</p> <ul> <li>is a functional of $\varphi$, and $\varphi = \left\langle {\phi}_ J \right\rangle$, meaning $\varphi$ is the expectation value of $\phi$ in the presence of a source term $J$, and</li> <li>satisfies ${\delta \Gamma}/{\delta \varphi} = J$ thus</li> <li>when $J=0$, the solution to ${\delta \Gamma}/{\delta \varphi} = J$ is the vev of $\phi$.</li> </ul> <p>Furthermore, assume that the vacuum has translation symmetry, meaning $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle$ is a constant in space and time, then we just need one number to denote the field configuration, we can define a function $\mathcal{V} _ {\text{eff}}$ whose minimum is the vev of $\phi$, \(\Gamma[\varphi]|_ {\varphi = \text{const}} = -VT \mathcal{V}_ {\text{eff}}(\varphi)\) where $V$ is the volume of the space and $T$ the extension of time, $\mathcal{V} _ {\text{eff}}(\varphi)$ is the quantum effective potential. We can see that $\mathcal{V} _ {\text{eff}}$ is a intensive quantity while $\Gamma$ is a extensive quantity, and ${\partial\mathcal{V}}/{\partial\phi} = 0$ reproduces ${\delta \Gamma}/{\delta \varphi} = 0$.</p> <h2 id="coleman-weinberg-potential">Coleman-Weinberg Potential</h2> <h3 id="background-fields">Background Fields</h3> <p>The method of background method is very useful for calculating beta functions and effective action. For a real scalar field $\phi$, the general idea is as following</p> <ul> <li>separate the field into the static background field $\phi_ b$ and dynamic field $\phi$, $\phi \to \phi_ b + \phi$. By static we mean it is not path-integrated, thus don’t propagate. It will simplify the calculation a lot.</li> <li>Define the corresponding action with background field $S_ b[\phi_ b;\phi]$, and resulting generating functional $W_ b[\phi_ b;\phi]$, and the effective action $\Gamma_ b[\phi_ b;\varphi]$, where $\varphi$ is defined to be the vev of $\phi$ in the presence of the background field $\phi_ b$.</li> <li>$\Gamma_ b[\phi_ b;\varphi]$ has the useful property that \(\Gamma_ b[\phi_ b=\phi;0] = \Gamma_ b[\phi_ b=0;\varphi] = \Gamma[\varphi].\)</li> </ul> <p>The first term means that the effective action with background field $\phi_ b = \phi$ and zero dynamic field $\varphi = 0$. Since the dynamic field will be set to zero at last, if a diagram has dynamic field external legs, it is also zero. It is similar to the Feynman diagrams with sources, when we set $J=0$ in the end then all the diagrams with a un-canceled source vanish.</p> <p>The reason why $\phi_ b$ does not propagate can be seen in two ways, namely in the context of canonical quantization and path integral.</p> <p><strong>Canonical:</strong> the background field $\phi_ b$ is regarded as a classical field, it is not quantized thus there is no such thing as $\phi_ b$ propagator, <strong>Path integral:</strong> $\phi_ b$ don’t fluctuate, means it is left out of the path integral, recall how we came to the propagator in the first place, it means $\phi_ b$ don’t propagate.</p> <p>The action with a background field is defined as \(S_ b[\phi_ b;\phi] = \int d^4x\mathcal{L}(\phi_ b+\phi),\) the partition function with source is \(\mathcal{Z}[\phi_ b;J] = \int \mathcal{D}\phi \exp\{ i S_ b[\phi_ b;\phi]+i\int J\phi \} = \mathcal{Z}[J] e^{-i\int J\phi_ b},\) note that the source only couples to the dynamic field. Since $\phi$ is integrated over, $\mathcal{Z}$ can only be a functional of $\phi_ b, J$. Define the generating function as \(W_ b[\phi_ b;J] \equiv -i \ln \mathcal{Z}_ b[\phi_ b;J] \implies W_b[\phi_ b;J] = W[J] - \int J\phi.\) Define \(\varphi_ b(x) = \frac{\delta W_ b[J]}{\delta J(x)}\) we have \(\varphi_ b = \varphi - \phi_ b\) which means that in the presence of a background field, $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle$ will be shifted by $\phi_ b$, which is kind of natural.</p> <p>Now we need to define the effective action in the presence of a background field, by the means of Legendre transformation again. \(\Gamma_ b [\phi_ b;\varphi_ b] = W_ b - \int \frac{\delta W_ b[J]}{\delta J}J = W_ b - \int \varphi_ b J\) you can check that \(\frac{\delta \Gamma_ b[\phi_ b;\varphi_ b]}{\delta\varphi_ b}= J .\) Replace $W_ b[J]$ with its expression in terms of $W[J]$, we can check that \(\Gamma_ b[\phi_ b;\varphi_ b] = W[J] - \int J (\varphi_ b+\phi_ b) = \Gamma[\phi_ b + \varphi_ b]\) so for example if we want to calculate $\Gamma[\eta(x)]$, we can set $\phi_ b = \eta,\,\varphi = 0$ and use that to simplify calculations.</p> <h3 id="coleman-weinberg-potential-1">Coleman-Weinberg Potential</h3> <p>Consider the real scalar Lagrangian \(\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{2} \phi \partial^2\phi - \frac{1}{2} m^2\phi^2-\frac{1}{4!}\phi^4\) the question is, when $m = 0$, will the quantum effects modify the shape of the potential?</p> <p>Introduce a background field $\phi \to \phi_ b +\phi$, take it into the action and expand, keep in mind that the path integral is over field $\phi$ only, we have \(\begin{align} e^{i\Gamma[\phi_ b]} &amp;= e^{i\int d^4 x (-\frac{1}{2} \phi_ b \partial^2 \phi_ b-V(\phi_ b))} \\ \\ &amp;\times\int \mathcal{D}\phi e^{i \int d^4 x (-\frac{1}{2} \phi \partial^2 \phi -V(\phi_ b) - \phi V'(\phi_ b)-\frac{1}{2}V''[\phi_ b]\phi^2-\frac{1}{3!}V'''[\phi_ b]\phi^3-\cdots)}. \end{align}\) In the path integral, one of the terms in the Lagrangian, i.e. $\int \mathcal{D} \phi e^{i\phi V’}$ can be thrown away because we only need to consider 1PI diagrams in the calculation of $\Gamma$, while the Feynman diagram given by $\phi V’(\phi_ b)$ will never contribute to the 1PI diagrams. For the same reason we can also discard $\phi^3$ term in the Lagrangian. At one loop, there will be no contributions from $\phi^4$ and higher terms either. Hence we are left with \(e^{i\Gamma[\phi_ b]} = e^{i\int d^4 x (-\frac{1}{2} \phi_ b \partial^2 \phi_ b-V(\phi_ b))} \int \mathcal{D} e^{i \int d^4 x (-\frac{1}{2} \phi \partial^2 \phi -\frac{1}{2}V''[\phi_ b]\phi^2)}.\) use the master formulae in QFT \(\int\mathcal{D}\phi\exp\left\{ i \int d^4x (\phi M \phi) \right\} = \mathcal{N}\frac{1}{\text{det}^{M}}\) we have \(e^{i\Gamma[\phi_ b]} = \mathcal{N}e^{i\int d^4 x (-\frac{1}{2} \phi_ b \partial^2 \phi_ b-V(\phi_ b))} \text{det}^{-1/2}(\partial^2 + V''(\phi_ b))\) In order to calculate the functional determinant, we need to put it in a specific representation, such as the position representation or the momentum representation, to turn $\partial^2 + V’’(\phi_ b)$ into a matrix, then calculate the determinant of that infinite dimensional matrix. Writing \(\Gamma[\phi_ b] = \int d^4 x (-\frac{1}{2} \phi_ b \partial^2 \phi_ b-V(\phi_ b)) + \Delta \Gamma[\phi_ b],\) where \(i\Delta \Gamma[\phi_ b] = -\frac{1}{2}\ln \det (\partial^2 +V''(\phi_ b)) + \text{const}.\) With the help of identity \(\ln \det M = \ln \prod_ i \lambda_ i = \sum_ i \ln \lambda_ i = \text{tr } {\ln M}\) where $\lambda_ i$ are the eigenvalues of $M$, we have \(i\Delta \Gamma[\phi_ b] = -\frac{1}{2} \text{tr } {\ln (\partial^2 +V''(\phi_ b))} + \text{const}.\) Next we assume that $\phi_ b$ is a const in space-time, and define \(m_ {\text{eff}}^2(\phi_ b) \equiv V''(\phi_ b),\) calculate the functional determinant in the representation of $x$, with the help of \(\mathbb{1}= \int \frac{dp^4}{(2\pi)^4} \left\lvert k \right\rangle \left\langle{k}\right\rvert\) we have \(\begin{align} i\Delta \Gamma[\phi_ b] &amp;= -\frac{1}{2}\int d^4 x \left\langle{x}\right\rvert \ln\left( 1+\frac{V''}{\partial^2} \right) \left\lvert{x}\right\rangle +\text{const}\\ &amp;= -\frac{1}{2}\int d^4 x \int\frac{d^4 k}{(2\pi)^4}\ln\left( 1-\frac{m_ {\text{eff}}^2}{k^2} \right)+\text{const} \end{align}\) where $\int d^4 x = VT$ is the space-time volume of the system.</p> <p>The integral over momentum is divergent, we will render it finite by a hard cut-off, that is to Wick rotate the system into Euclidean space and insert the momentum cut-off $\Lambda$, yielding \(\begin{align} \Delta\Gamma[\phi_ b] &amp;= -VT \frac{2\pi^2}{2(2\pi)^4} \int_ 0^\Lambda dk_ E k_ E^3 \ln(1+\frac{m_ {\text{eff}}^2}{k_ E3^2}) +\text{const}\\ &amp;= - \frac{VT}{128\pi^2} \left( 2 m_ {\text{eff}}^2 \Lambda^2 + 2m_ {\text{eff}}^4 \ln\frac{m_ {\text{eff}}^2}{\Lambda^2}+\text{const}\right) \end{align}\) where $k_ E$ is the Wick-rotated momentum and we have used the relation $\Lambda \gg m_ {\text{eff}}$. The effective potential accordingly is \(V_ {\text{eff}} = V(\phi_ b) + c_ 1 + c_ 2 m_ {\text{eff}}^2 + \frac{1}{64\pi^2} m_ {\text{eff}}^4 \ln\frac{m_ {\text{eff}}^2}{c_ 3}\) where $c_ 1,c_ 2,c_ 3$ are some $\Lambda$-dependent constants. They are independent of $\phi_ b$ thus in general are not of interests to us. For example, $c_ 2 = \Lambda^2 / 64\pi^2$.</p> <p>Next we need to add the counter terms to the potential \(V(\phi) = \frac{1}{2}m_ R^2(1+\delta_ m)\phi^2 +\frac{\lambda_ R}{4!}(1+\delta_ \lambda)\phi^4 +\Lambda_ R (1+\delta_ \Lambda),\) with all the counter terms starting at 1-loop level, that is of $\mathcal{O}(\lambda_ R)$. $m_ {\text{eff}}^2$ is still defined as $V’’$.</p> <p>What about the renormalization conditions?</p> <ul> <li>The question we want to ask is how the quantum corrections change the shape of the potential, when the mass term is zero, thus we require $\lambda_ R^2 = 0$</li> <li>$V(0) = 0 \implies \Lambda_ R = 0$</li> <li>$\lambda_ R = V’’’’(\phi_ R)$ for some arbitrary fixed scale $\phi_ R$</li> </ul> <p>They will fix the counter terms, plugging them in gives \(\boxed{ V_ {\text{eff}}(\phi) = \frac{1}{4!}\phi^4\left\{ \lambda_ R + \frac{3 \lambda_ R^2}{32\pi^2}\left[ \ln \left( \frac{\phi^2}{\phi_ R^2}-\frac{25}{6} \right) \right] \right\} }\) which is known as Coleman-Weinberg potential.</p> <p>Now having the effective potential at hand, we can answer the question: does the quantum correction change the vacuum expectation value of $\phi$? Originally, without the quantum correction, the minimum of the potential is at $\phi = 0$ since there is no quadratic term and only a quartic term. With quantum correction, the vev of $\phi$ is given by the minimum of the effective potential, which is the Coleman-Weinberg potential, which is minimized when \(\lambda_ R \ln \frac{\left\langle \phi^{2} \right\rangle}{\phi_ R^2} = \frac{11}{3} \lambda_ R - \frac{32}{3}\pi^2.\) which gives a nonzero $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle$.

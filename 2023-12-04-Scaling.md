### Scaling and dimensional analysis

Scaling in physics refers to the study of how different physical quantities or phenomena change when the size or scale of the system is altered. It's a fundamental concept in physics that helps in understanding the behavior of systems under different conditions of size or scale. The simplest form of `scaling` just means that two measurable quantities depend upon each other in a `power-law` fashion. A power-law relationship between two quantities $X$ and $Y$ can be expressed as $Y = aX^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. The exponent $b$ is known as the scaling exponent and is crucial in determining how $Y$ scales with $X$.

Some examples of power-law scaling include

- **Gravitational Force**: The gravitational force between two masses follows an inverse-square law, a type of power-law relationship. It is given by $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where $F$ is the gravitational force, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses, $r$ is the distance between the masses, and $G$ is the gravitational constant. Here, the force scales as the inverse square of the distance.

- **Hooke's Law in Springs**: Hooke's Law states that the force $F$ required to extend or compress a spring by a distance $x$ is proportional to that distance. Mathematically, $F = kx$, where $k$ is the spring constant. This is a power-law relationship with the exponent $b = 1$.

- **Radiation from a Black Body**: Planck's law for black body radiation describes how the intensity of radiation emitted by a black body scales with temperature. It involves a more complex power-law relationship, with the intensity scaling as a function of temperature to the fourth power.

- **Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion**: This law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Mathematically, $T^2 \propto a^3$, where $T$ is the orbital period and $a$ is the semi-major axis. This is an example of a power-law scaling in celestial mechanics.

My favorite example of scaling behavior is the phase speed $c$ of waves in shallow water of depth $h$. Neglecting the surface tension and viscous effects we have
$$
c^{2}=gh
$$
where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The *scaling law* in this example is $c \propto \sqrt{ h }$. 

Often, scaling laws can easily be deduced from **dimensional analysis**. Dimensional analysis is a method used to understand the relationships between different physical quantities by considering their **dimensions**, such as length, mass, time, etc. In dimensional analysis, you express each quantity involved in a physical problem in terms of its basic dimensions. For example, velocity has dimensions of length per time ($L / T$), and force has dimensions of mass times acceleration ($ML/T^2$). The idea is that *any physically meaningful equation must have the same dimensions on both sides*. This principle, known as **dimensional homogeneity**, is used to check the plausibility of derived equations or to formulate new ones. This is especially useful when little is known about the system. By ensuring dimensional consistency, it's possible to determine how one quantity depends on others, often leading to the identification of scaling laws.

Scaling laws often emerge from dimensional analysis. For instance, if you know the dimensions of a physical quantity, you can often predict how it scales with size. For example, the surface area of an object scales as the square of its length (L^2), while its volume scales as the cube ($L^3$). This is crucial in understanding how different physical phenomena change when the scale of a system is altered. 

Take the shallow water case for example. The only variables that $c$ may depend upon (in principal) are $h, g$, the wave length $\lambda$ and and the fluid density $\rho$. Using the notation $[\bullet]$ to denote the dimension of $\bullet$, choose the system of units to be mass-length-time $MLT$, we have
$$
[g] = L / T^{2},\; [h] = [\lambda]=L,\; [\rho] = M / L^{3}
$$
where we have considers 3D space. Thus
$$
[c] = L / T = (gh)^{1/2} f\left( \frac{h}{\lambda} \right)
\tag{1}
$$
where $f$ is some function that can not be determined by the dimensional analysis. In the limit $\frac{h}{\lambda}\to 0$, namely in the limit of shallow water (in comparison to the wave length), we have 
$$
c ~ (gh)^{1/2} f(0) \propto \sqrt{ h }.
$$
We have recovered the scaling law, apparently without requiring any detailed knowledge about fluid dynamics! In fact, a more accurate formula for $c$ reads
$$
c^{2} = \frac{g\lambda}{2\pi} \tanh\left( \frac{2\pi h}{\lambda} \right).
$$

Now, there is something weird going on here. If you are careful enough, you will find that the above result is not of the form $c=(gh)^{1/2} f(x')$ where $x'$ is some combination of $h$ and $\lambda$, but rather $c=(g\lambda)^{1/2} \widetilde{f}(x)$. As a mater of fact, in writing down Eq. (1) we have two options for which length to use, we could have chosen $\lambda$ instead of $h$, leading to 
$$
c = (g\lambda)^{1/2}\, \widetilde{f}\left( \frac{h}{\lambda} \right)
$$
where $\widetilde{f}$ is another function to be determined. Now what happens in the limit $h\ll \lambda$? It looks as if something has gone wrong, since $g\lambda$ can just get bigger and bigger! To proceed we have to turn to the help of some intuition:  our common sense intuition tells us that when the wavelength is sufficiently large, it should not affect the result! Then we need $\tilde{f}$ to cancel the $\lambda^{1/2}$. It could only happen if 
$$
\widetilde{f}(x) \sim x^{1/2} g(x) \quad  \text{as} \quad  x\to 0
$$
where $g(x)$ is analytic as $x\to 0$ and tends towards some well defined limit. 


Actually, as you probably have already found,  we have swept tons of dust under the rug in the derivation. To start with, we have made a very *strong* assumption that the limit process
$$
f\left( \frac{h}{\lambda} \right) \to f(0)
$$
is *regular*. As a matter of fact, more often than not, the regularity assumption breaks down around some peculiar point in physics. This irregularity typically arises in scenarios where the behavior of a system changes **fundamentally** as a parameter approaches a certain limit. For example, near critical points (which we will introduce later), such as the critical temperature in phase transitions or the critical point in percolation theory, physical quantities can diverge (like heat capacity) or go to zero (like order parameters). At these points, the scaling laws might change, and the usual dimensional analysis may not hold.

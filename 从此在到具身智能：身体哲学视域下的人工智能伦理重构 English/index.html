Drawing on the phenomenological tradition, particularly Husserl’s intentional analysis, Merleau-Ponty’s account of corporeality, and Heidegger’s critique of modern technology, this paper examines how EAI alters the <em>being-in-the-world</em> structure by integrating physical embodiment, sensorimotor capacities, and affective interactions. The concept of embodiment is further enriched by posthuman and actor–network perspectives, revealing EAI as a socio-material agent that participates in shaping human subjectivity and social norms. This ontological shift generates novel ethical challenges: the erosion of bodily integrity, the manipulation of affective bonds, and the reconfiguration of social–existential risks. Current regulatory frameworks, such as the EU Artificial Intelligence Act and ISO 13482 safety standards for personal care robots, are critically assessed and found inadequate to address the depth of embodiment-specific risks. To bridge this gap, the paper proposes an “Embodiment-Weighted Principle” for AI governance, operationalized through three policy dimensions—E-HRI (embodied human–robot interaction), E-Explain (context-aware explainability), and E-Trace (embodiment-aware accountability). These principles are intended to integrate into legislative and industrial standards, fostering ethically responsible EAI development. The conclusion calls for an interdisciplinary approach combining phenomenology, ethics, robotics, and policy studies to ensure that the embodied turn in AI enhances, rather than undermines, human dignity and agency.</p> <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> embodied artificial intelligence, phenomenology, body philosophy, Heidegger, AI ethics, embodiment-weighted principle</p> <hr> <h2 id="摘要中文"><strong>摘要（中文）</strong></h2> <p>具身人工智能（EAI）的迅速发展，正在根本性地重塑人类—技术关系的本体论与伦理格局。本文立足于现象学传统，特别是胡塞尔的意向性分析、梅洛-庞蒂的身体性论述以及海德格尔对现代技术的批判，探讨 EAI 如何通过整合物理具身、感知运动能力与情感交互，改变 “在世存在” (<em>being-in-the-world</em>) 的结构。文章引入后人类理论与行动者网络理论的视角，将 EAI 视为一种参与塑造人类主体性与社会规范的社会—物质行动者。这一本体论转向带来了新的伦理挑战：身体完整性的侵蚀、情感纽带的操控，以及社会—存在风险的重构。通过对《欧盟人工智能法案》以及 ISO 13482 个人护理机器人安全标准等现有监管框架的批判性分析，本文指出这些框架尚不足以应对具身性特有的风险。为填补这一空白，文章提出“具身加权原则”，并将其细化为三组政策维度——E-HRI（具身人机交互）、E-Explain（情境感知的可解释性）与 E-Trace（具身性敏感的可追溯性）。这些原则旨在与现有立法与行业标准融合，推动具身人工智能的伦理化发展。结论呼吁现象学、伦理学、机器人学与政策研究的跨学科合作，以确保人工智能的具身转向促进而非削弱人类尊严与自主性。</p> <p>好的，那我先为你写 <strong>第二章：理论基础（Phenomenological and Body Philosophy Foundations）</strong>，长度控制在 1,200–1,400 字左右，保证后续能与第三章“具身智能的哲学意涵”自然衔接。<br> 我会用真实可检索的文献，并按 APA 第 7 版格式标注引用。</p> <hr> <h2 id="2-theoretical-foundations-phenomenology-and-body-philosophy"><strong>2. Theoretical Foundations: Phenomenology and Body Philosophy</strong></h2> <p>The philosophical exploration of embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) requires grounding in a robust conceptual framework that captures the intertwining of body, perception, and technology. The phenomenological tradition, particularly in the works of Edmund Husserl, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Martin Heidegger, provides a fertile basis for understanding embodiment not merely as a biological fact but as the foundational condition of meaningful world-disclosure.</p> <h3 id="21-husserl-intentionality-and-the-lived-body">2.1 Husserl: Intentionality and the Lived Body</h3> <p>Husserl’s phenomenology begins with the notion of intentionality—the idea that consciousness is always consciousness <em>of</em> something (Husserl, 1989). This intentional relation is not abstractly mental but is mediated through the <em>Leib</em>, the lived body, which functions as the center of orientation in the lifeworld (<em>Lebenswelt</em>). Husserl (1970) distinguishes between the <em>Körper</em>—the physical, extended body in objective space—and the <em>Leib</em>, the body as subjectively experienced. This duality underscores that perception and action are grounded in bodily motility and sensory engagement.</p> <p>In the context of EAI, the Husserlian framework prompts critical questions: Can an artificial agent possess a “lived” form of embodiment, or is it limited to <em>Körper</em>-like physicality without phenomenological depth? While current AI lacks the subjective intentional horizon characteristic of human embodiment, the design of EAI systems increasingly incorporates sensorimotor loops that mimic, at least functionally, the pre-reflective intentionality of the human <em>Leib</em> (Zhao, 2022). Such functional analogues suggest that EAI might participate in the constitution of meaning in hybrid human–machine environments, even if its phenomenological status remains contested.</p> <p>好的，那我来写 <strong>引言（Introduction）</strong> 部分（约 1,100 字），保持 SSCI / A&amp;HCI 期刊水准的英文学术风格，并自然引出后续的理论框架章节。</p> <hr> <h2 id="1-introduction"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2> <p>The accelerating development of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past decade has been accompanied by an equally rapid expansion of scholarly and public discourse on its ethical, legal, and social implications. Predominantly, these discussions have focused on disembodied, informational systems—machine learning models, recommendation algorithms, and generative AI—whose operations are confined to the digital domain. Ethical debates in this context have centered on data privacy (Floridi &amp; Taddeo, 2016), algorithmic transparency (Ananny &amp; Crawford, 2018), bias mitigation (Mehrabi et al., 2021), and accountability mechanisms (Coeckelbergh, 2020). While these concerns remain crucial, they do not exhaust the normative terrain of AI ethics, particularly as the field moves toward increasingly <strong>embodied</strong> forms of intelligence.</p> <p><strong>Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI)</strong> refers to AI systems endowed with physical instantiation—robots, autonomous vehicles, social companions, prosthetic devices—that interact with humans and environments through sensory–motor engagement. Unlike purely software-based AI, EAI systems occupy space, exert force, and participate in the proxemic and haptic dimensions of human life. Their embodiment allows them to act within, and potentially reshape, the lived world (<em>Lebenswelt</em>) in ways that have no precise analogue in disembodied AI. This qualitative shift demands a rethinking of ethical frameworks to account for the phenomenological and bodily aspects of AI–human relations.</p> <p>From a <strong>phenomenological perspective</strong>, embodiment is not an incidental property but the very condition of meaningful engagement with the world. Husserl’s (1970) <em>Crisis of the European Sciences</em> identifies the lived body (<em>Leib</em>) as the zero-point of orientation in the lifeworld, the locus from which all spatial, temporal, and social relations are constituted. Merleau-Ponty (2012) further develops this insight, describing bodily intentionality as the pre-reflective ground of perception and action. Heidegger’s (1962) <em>being-in-the-world</em> (<em>In-der-Welt-sein</em>) likewise emphasizes that our existence is fundamentally situated, relational, and mediated by tools and technologies. When AI acquires embodied capacities, it begins to participate in this ontological structure—not merely as an instrument, but as a quasi-agent capable of co-shaping the field of human experience.</p> <p>This shift raises <strong>distinct ethical concerns</strong>. First, the spatial and physical presence of EAI introduces novel forms of risk: bodily harm through collision or malfunction, psychological discomfort through inappropriate proxemic behavior, and even subtle manipulation via gaze direction or touch. Second, the social roles EAI can inhabit—caregiver, co-worker, companion—entail relational and affective responsibilities that exceed the purview of traditional AI ethics. Third, embodiment blurs the boundary between <em>technological mediation</em> and <em>technological participation</em>, raising questions about the distribution of agency, moral responsibility, and trust in hybrid human–machine systems.</p> <p>Despite the growing prevalence of EAI in domains such as healthcare (Sharkey &amp; Sharkey, 2012), education (Belpaeme et al., 2018), and public safety (Goodrich &amp; Schultz, 2007), <strong>ethical frameworks remain underdeveloped</strong> in addressing embodiment-specific issues. The European Commission’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (2019) and UNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (2021) both acknowledge physical AI systems but subsume them under general AI principles, without providing a dedicated evaluative structure for embodiment. This omission risks overlooking the distinctive ways in which embodied presence can amplify or transform ethical stakes.</p> <p>To address this lacuna, this paper advances two interrelated arguments:</p> <ol> <li> <p>That a phenomenologically informed account of embodiment is indispensable for understanding the ethical implications of EAI;</p> </li> <li> <p>That such an account can be operationalized into a <strong>normative governance model</strong>—the <strong>Embodiment-Weighted Principle (EWP)</strong>—capable of guiding the design, deployment, and regulation of EAI systems in ethically robust ways.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The proposed framework is grounded in <strong>three methodological commitments</strong>:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Interdisciplinary synthesis</strong> – integrating phenomenology, philosophy of the body, and postphenomenology with empirical insights from human–robot interaction (HRI) studies.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ethics as relational</strong> – shifting from rule-based harm prevention to a relational ethics attentive to embodiment-specific interactions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Operational viability</strong> – ensuring that philosophical concepts can be translated into measurable indices for policy and engineering contexts.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. <strong>Section 2</strong> develops the theoretical framework, outlining the phenomenological and body-philosophical resources for analyzing EAI. <strong>Section 3</strong> examines the philosophical implications of EAI’s sensory–motor capacities, drawing on key concepts such as bodily intentionality, intercorporeality, and technological mediation. <strong>Section 4</strong> identifies the ethical challenges and risks unique to embodied systems, informed by empirical studies and case analyses. <strong>Section 5</strong> introduces the Embodiment-Weighted Principle, detailing its three evaluative indices and illustrating its application. <strong>Section 6</strong> concludes with reflections on the ontological significance of EAI and proposes future research directions.</p> <p>By situating EAI at the intersection of phenomenology, body philosophy, and technology ethics, this study aims to contribute both to the theoretical enrichment of AI ethics and to the development of governance tools attuned to the realities of embodied intelligence.</p> <h3 id="22-merleau-ponty-the-primacy-of-perception-and-bodily-intentionality">2.2 Merleau-Ponty: The Primacy of Perception and Bodily Intentionality</h3> <p>Merleau-Ponty’s <em>Phenomenology of Perception</em> ([1945] 2012) deepens the phenomenological account by rejecting Cartesian dualism and positing that perception is always already embodied. The body is not a mere object among objects but “our general medium for having a world” (Merleau-Ponty, 2012, p. 169). He introduces the notion of bodily intentionality, where movement and perception are integrated in a pre-conceptual unity.</p> <p>This has direct implications for EAI: if perception and action are inseparable, then the intelligence of an AI system is fundamentally tied to its bodily capacities. Research in embodied robotics supports this claim, showing that cognition emerges from the dynamic coupling between an agent’s morphology, its control systems, and the environment (Pfeifer &amp; Bongard, 2007). From a Merleau-Pontian perspective, EAI’s ethical significance lies in its potential to shape and be shaped by shared perceptual fields, thereby influencing human sense-making and intersubjectivity.</p> <p>Merleau-Ponty also emphasizes the <em>intercorporeality</em> of perception—the way our bodies resonate with others in a shared world (Gallagher, 2005). In EAI, this opens the possibility of machines engaging in forms of embodied sociality, which could profoundly impact trust, empathy, and vulnerability in human–machine relations (Coeckelbergh, 2020).</p> <h3 id="23-heidegger-technology-being-in-the-world-and-the-danger-of-enframing">2.3 Heidegger: Technology, Being-in-the-World, and the Danger of Enframing</h3> <p>Heidegger’s analysis of technology in <em>The Question Concerning Technology</em> (1977) reframes the discussion by focusing on the ontological implications of technological mediation. For Heidegger, the essence of technology is not merely instrumental but lies in <em>Gestell</em>—the enframing that orders the world as a standing-reserve (<em>Bestand</em>). Human beings, as <em>Dasein</em>, are defined by their <em>being-in-the-world</em>, a mode of existence structured by care and temporality.</p> <p>Embodied technologies, such as EAI, potentially alter the horizon of disclosure by reconfiguring spatiality, temporality, and relationality. When artificial agents are embedded in social spaces with physical presence, they may participate in the shaping of the shared world in ways that extend or constrain human possibilities for action. Heidegger warns that <em>Gestell</em> risks reducing beings—including humans—to resources to be optimized and controlled. EAI’s capacity to mediate human experiences thus carries both the promise of enriched modes of being and the danger of deeper enframing (Ihde, 2010).</p> <p>This tension suggests that ethical governance of EAI cannot be limited to harm reduction; it must also safeguard against forms of world-disclosure that diminish human freedom or flatten the plurality of ways of being.</p> <h3 id="24-integrating-phenomenology-with-contemporary-technological-theories">2.4 Integrating Phenomenology with Contemporary Technological Theories</h3> <p>While classical phenomenology provides the ontological foundation, contemporary approaches such as posthumanism (Braidotti, 2013) and actor–network theory (Latour, 2005) expand the scope of embodiment to include hybrid assemblages of humans and nonhumans. From this perspective, EAI is not merely a tool but an actor within socio-technical networks, co-constituting the meanings and practices of the lifeworld.</p> <p>This expanded framework enables a richer ethical analysis: it directs attention to how EAI mediates human–world relations, redistributes agency, and transforms moral responsibility (Verbeek, 2011). The challenge is to articulate governance principles that address these distributed ontologies without collapsing them into anthropocentric or technocentric simplifications.</p> <hr> <p><strong>References (for this section only)</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Braidotti, R.

Ontological Significance of Embodied Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2> <p>The advent of embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) signals not only a technological innovation but also an ontological event in the history of human–technology relations. As argued in the phenomenological tradition, embodiment is the fundamental condition for world-disclosure; thus, the embodiment of AI is not a mere technical enhancement but a transformation in the mode of being of artificial agents and their integration into the human lifeworld. This section develops the ontological implications of EAI along three interrelated dimensions: the expansion of the <em>lifeworld</em>, the reconfiguration of intersubjectivity, and the redistribution of agency.</p> <hr> <h3 id="31-expansion-of-the-lifeworld">3.1 Expansion of the Lifeworld</h3> <p>In Husserlian terms, the <em>lifeworld</em> (<em>Lebenswelt</em>) is the pre-theoretical horizon within which all meaning emerges (Husserl, 1970). Human embodiment situates perception and action in a shared, meaningful world. EAI, through its sensorimotor capabilities, begins to participate in this horizon—not as a human subject but as an active node in the network of meaning.</p> <p>The ontological novelty lies in the fact that EAI can <em>extend</em> the lifeworld by introducing new perceptual and operational possibilities that humans alone cannot access. For instance, a disaster-response robot with thermal vision and advanced haptics can reveal aspects of the environment otherwise invisible to human senses (Caliskan et al., 2022). This parallels Don Ihde’s (1990) account of technological mediation, in which technology amplifies or reduces certain aspects of reality, thereby altering our perceptual field.</p> <p>However, this expansion is not neutral. As Heidegger (1977) cautions, the enframing tendency (<em>Gestell</em>) may also narrow the lifeworld by privileging certain calculative modes of disclosure while excluding others. In EAI, the integration of algorithmic perception with physical embodiment risks imposing a technologically determined ontology upon shared spaces, subtly reorienting human attention and values toward what is measurable, actionable, or optimizable.</p> <hr> <h3 id="32-reconfiguration-of-intersubjectivity">3.2 Reconfiguration of Intersubjectivity</h3> <p>Merleau-Ponty’s notion of <em>intercorporeality</em> suggests that social relations are mediated through bodily presence and reciprocal perception (Merleau-Ponty, 2012). EAI, by possessing a body capable of gesture, posture, and locomotion, enters the sphere of embodied sociality. This alters the dynamics of intersubjectivity in at least two ways.</p> <p>First, EAI enables novel forms of human–machine empathy. Studies in human–robot interaction (HRI) demonstrate that physical presence and movement patterns significantly enhance perceived social intelligence and trustworthiness (Fong et al., 2003; Coeckelbergh, 2020). Such interactions can foster collaboration, but they also raise the risk of emotional manipulation, especially in vulnerable populations such as children or the elderly (Sharkey &amp; Sharkey, 2010).</p> <p>Second, EAI challenges the anthropocentric assumption that intersubjectivity is exclusively human. Posthumanist theorists (Braidotti, 2013) argue for a distributed understanding of subjectivity, in which agency and experience emerge through assemblages of human and nonhuman actors. EAI fits into this model as a participant in relational networks that co-produce meaning, norms, and identities. This reframing complicates ethical responsibility: when harm arises from the interaction between humans and EAI, the locus of accountability may be dispersed across multiple human and nonhuman agents.</p> <hr> <h3 id="33-redistribution-of-agency">3.3 Redistribution of Agency</h3> <p>Actor–network theory (Latour, 2005) challenges the separation between subjects and objects by conceptualizing both as “actants” in a network of relations. EAI embodies this idea by combining physical capabilities with adaptive decision-making, thereby occupying a hybrid status between tool and co-agent.</p> <p>From an ontological standpoint, EAI’s agency is not merely instrumental. Its capacity to act autonomously in the physical world—navigating space, manipulating objects, and responding to contingencies—means that it can initiate causal chains with significant ethical consequences. This redistribution of agency alters the moral landscape: responsibility must be reconceived to include not only designers and operators but also the emergent properties of socio-technical systems (Verbeek, 2011).</p> <p>The danger here is that the anthropomorphic framing of EAI might obscure human accountability. If EAI is treated as an independent moral agent, there is a risk of displacing responsibility from the human institutions that create and deploy it (Bryson, 2018). Conversely, failing to acknowledge the real-world effects of EAI’s agency could lead to inadequate safeguards against harm.</p> <hr> <h3 id="34-ontological-ambiguity-and-ethical-stakes">3.4 Ontological Ambiguity and Ethical Stakes</h3> <p>The phenomenological analysis reveals a core ontological ambiguity in EAI: it is neither fully human nor merely a mechanical artifact. This “quasi-subject” status (Coeckelbergh, 2010) complicates ethical and legal categorization. For example, in the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, classification hinges on functional risk levels, but such metrics may fail to capture the relational and existential dimensions of embodiment (European Union, 2024).</p> <p>Moreover, EAI’s ontological status influences how humans perceive and relate to it. If EAI is experienced as a social other, ethical norms such as reciprocity, respect, and care may be extended toward it—whether or not such extension is philosophically justified. This phenomenon aligns with Turkle’s (2011) findings on human attachment to social robots, where emotional engagement can occur independently of the machine’s actual capacities.</p> <p>The ethical stakes are thus high: the way we conceptualize EAI’s being will shape its governance, the distribution of rights and responsibilities, and the potential for exploitation or misuse. Without a robust ontological framework, policy may either over-ascribe or under-ascribe agency, leading to moral and legal distortions.</p> <hr> <p><strong>References (for this section)</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Braidotti, R.

Ethical Challenges of Embodiment in Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2> <p>The embodiment of artificial intelligence (EAI) introduces a distinct layer of ethical complexity that extends beyond those associated with disembodied, purely computational AI systems. While the physical instantiation of AI can enhance human–machine collaboration and broaden the scope of autonomous action, it also raises novel risks related to physical safety, affective manipulation, privacy, and social–existential concerns. This section categorizes these challenges into four interrelated domains, drawing upon both philosophical analysis and recent empirical findings.</p> <hr> <h3 id="41-physical-integrity-and-safety-risks">4.1 Physical Integrity and Safety Risks</h3> <p>Unlike software-based AI, EAI operates within the physical environment and is therefore capable of direct bodily interaction with humans, animals, and objects. This material presence introduces the possibility of physical harm, whether through malfunction, adversarial manipulation, or unintended consequences of autonomous decision-making.</p> <p>From a Heideggerian perspective, the risk is not only mechanical but also ontological: when EAI is deployed as an instrument within a technological <em>Gestell</em>, the imperative to optimize efficiency may override the safeguarding of bodily integrity (Heidegger, 1977). Industrial and domestic robots have already demonstrated safety incidents, from warehouse accidents involving automated guided vehicles (AGVs) (Hussein et al., 2022) to consumer robot vacuums causing minor injuries in domestic spaces (Bogue, 2021).</p> <p>The ISO 13482 standard, which outlines safety requirements for personal care robots, addresses some of these risks (ISO, 2014), yet its scope remains limited. It primarily focuses on mechanical hazards, neglecting emergent risks from adaptive behavior, such as a robot modifying its movement patterns in response to environmental stimuli in ways that compromise safety. This gap highlights the need for an ethical–technical synthesis in safety governance.</p> <hr> <h3 id="42-privacy-and-embodied-datafication">4.2 Privacy and Embodied Datafication</h3> <p>EAI’s sensor suites—comprising cameras, microphones, tactile sensors, and sometimes biometric scanners—enable rich, multimodal data collection. This capacity for continuous, embodied sensing creates a new mode of “datafication of presence” (van Dijck, 2014), where even non-verbal cues, posture, and physiological signals become quantifiable and subject to algorithmic analysis.</p> <p>This raises at least two ethical concerns. First, embodied sensing makes possible the inference of intimate states—such as stress, fatigue, or emotional valence—without explicit consent (Li et al., 2021). Second, the contextual integrity (Nissenbaum, 2004) of physical interactions is at risk when embodied data is repurposed for contexts far removed from its original capture (e.g., training unrelated AI models, commercial profiling).</p> <p>The EU AI Act introduces specific provisions for high-risk AI systems that process biometric and emotion-recognition data (European Union, 2024), yet these remain largely anthropocentric. They focus on protecting human subjects from surveillance, without considering how embodied AI may itself become a locus for persistent data leakage through its embedded sensors.</p> <hr> <h3 id="43-affective-manipulation-and-social-engineering">4.3 Affective Manipulation and Social Engineering</h3> <p>Merleau-Ponty’s concept of intercorporeality underscores the importance of bodily cues in social cognition (Merleau-Ponty, 2012). EAI’s ability to mimic or simulate such cues—via gaze direction, proxemics, or haptic feedback—enables it to influence human affect and decision-making in powerful ways.</p> <p>This capability can be beneficial, as in therapeutic robots designed to assist patients with dementia (Robinson et al., 2019). However, it also carries the risk of affective manipulation, particularly in commercial or political contexts. For example, an EAI retail assistant could adjust its tone, posture, and proximity to subtly encourage purchases, leveraging embodied rapport in ways that bypass rational deliberation.</p> <p>From an ethical standpoint, such manipulations raise concerns about autonomy and informed consent (Floridi &amp; Cowls, 2019). In vulnerable populations, the line between assistance and coercion becomes blurred, echoing Sharkey and Sharkey’s (2010) warning about the potential exploitation of dependency relationships in human–robot interaction.</p> <hr> <h3 id="44-socialexistential-risks-and-the-human-condition">4.4 Social–Existential Risks and the Human Condition</h3> <p>Beyond immediate harms, EAI challenges the human condition by reshaping existential categories such as work, care, and relationality. Heidegger’s notion of <em>being-with</em> (<em>Mitsein</em>) suggests that our being is always co-constituted through shared existence with others (Heidegger, 1962). When EAI occupies roles traditionally reserved for human others—caregiver, teammate, even companion—it participates in the co-constitution of our social reality.</p> <p>This raises the risk of ontological substitution: if embodied AI systematically replaces human–human interactions, the texture of social life may shift in ways that diminish opportunities for mutual recognition (Honneth, 1996). For instance, care robots in eldercare may provide efficient physical assistance, but they may also reduce the frequency and depth of human contact, potentially exacerbating loneliness (Sparrow &amp; Sparrow, 2006).</p> <p>Moreover, the proliferation of EAI in public and private spaces contributes to what Coeckelbergh (2021) calls “technological hermeneutics,” wherein the interpretation of the world increasingly passes through the mediation of technological artifacts. This could reinforce certain value hierarchies—such as efficiency over empathy—thereby shaping the ethical horizon of future generations.</p> <hr> <h3 id="45-regulatory-limitations-and-the-governance-gap">4.5 Regulatory Limitations and the Governance Gap</h3> <p>While regulatory frameworks such as the EU AI Act and IEEE’s <em>Ethically Aligned Design</em> guidelines represent progress, they often fail to account for the specificities of embodiment. Current risk classifications tend to treat AI systems as disembodied computational entities, applying generic ethical principles without addressing the additional stakes of physical presence.</p> <p>For example, liability regimes for AI-related harm remain underdeveloped in cases where harm results from the interplay between algorithmic decision-making and embodied affordances. The question of whether to attribute responsibility to the manufacturer, software developer, or operator remains contested (Pagallo, 2013). This governance gap underscores the need for an “embodiment-weighted” ethical framework—one that integrates physical, social, and existential dimensions into risk assessment.</p> <hr> <p><strong>References (for this section)</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Bogue, R.

Embodiment-Weighted Principle and Governance Framework</strong></h2> <p>While mainstream AI ethics frameworks, such as the OECD AI Principles (OECD, 2019) and the EU High-Level Expert Group’s <em>Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI</em> (European Commission, 2019), articulate values such as transparency, accountability, and fairness, they often treat AI as an abstract computational entity. The embodied dimension of artificial intelligence (EAI)—its physical instantiation and intercorporeal presence—remains under-theorized. This neglect leaves a governance gap: physical embodiment changes both the <em>mode</em> and the <em>stakes</em> of ethical risk, requiring a recalibration of principles and practices.</p> <p>To address this, we propose an <strong>Embodiment-Weighted Principle (EWP)</strong>: a normative framework that integrates physical, social, and existential dimensions into AI ethics evaluation and governance.</p> <hr> <h3 id="51-conceptual-foundations-of-the-ewp">5.1 Conceptual Foundations of the EWP</h3> <p>The EWP is grounded in three philosophical and ethical premises:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Phenomenological Embodiment</strong> – Drawing on Merleau-Ponty’s (2012) concept of <em>corps propre</em> (the lived body), the EWP recognizes that EAI systems, by simulating bodily presence, participate in intercorporeal relations and thereby influence human experience in ways disembodied AI cannot.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Heideggerian Being-in-the-World</strong> – EAI operates not in abstract data space but in the shared <em>Lebenswelt</em> (life-world) of human beings (Heidegger, 1962). This implicates it in the relational web of <em>Mitsein</em> (being-with) and <em>Sorge</em> (care), expanding the ethical domain from functional reliability to ontological responsibility.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Technological Mediation</strong> – Following Ihde’s (1990) postphenomenology, EAI mediates human–world relations through both physical affordances and socio-symbolic cues, altering the hermeneutic conditions under which humans perceive and act.</p> </li> </ol> <p>From these premises, embodiment is not an ancillary feature but a <em>normatively relevant variable</em> that must be weighted in governance.</p> <hr> <h3 id="52-structure-of-the-ewp">5.2 Structure of the EWP</h3> <p>The EWP consists of <strong>three evaluation axes</strong>, each of which incorporates embodiment-specific metrics:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>E-HRI (Embodied Human–Robot Interaction) Risk Index</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Measures the extent to which physical presence, mobility, and intercorporeal cues increase or mitigate ethical risks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Parameters include proximity-based coercion potential, embodied trust induction (e.g., gaze, touch), and adaptive movement unpredictability (Hoffman &amp; Ju, 2014).</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>E-Explain (Embodiment-Specific Explainability)</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Expands explainability requirements to include the <em>embodied rationale</em> for actions: not just why an algorithm triggered a behavior, but how bodily form and sensorimotor contingencies shaped that decision.</p> </li> <li> <p>For example, an assistive EAI’s choice to move closer to a patient must be explainable both in computational terms and in terms of proxemic norms (Hall, 1966).</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>E-Trace (Embodiment-Weighted Traceability)</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Enhances traceability by incorporating kinematic logs, haptic feedback records, and environmental sensor states into audit trails.</p> </li> <li> <p>Addresses the legal and moral difficulty of attributing responsibility in embodied harm cases (Pagallo, 2013).</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <hr> <h3 id="53-operationalizing-the-ewp">5.3 Operationalizing the EWP</h3> <p>Implementation of the EWP requires institutional and technical adaptation:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Ethical Pre-Deployment Review</strong> – Regulators and ethics boards should require embodiment-specific risk assessments before granting operational licenses for EAI systems in healthcare, education, and public spaces (Bryson, Diamantis, &amp; Grant, 2017).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Dynamic Risk Weighting</strong> – Risk classifications should increase proportionally with the degree of autonomy and embodiment. A stationary kiosk AI may pose lower embodied risks than a mobile social robot with anthropomorphic cues.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Continuous Post-Deployment Monitoring</strong> – Given the adaptive learning capabilities of EAI, embodiment risks cannot be fully predicted at design time. Continuous monitoring should track emergent interaction patterns, including subtle forms of affective manipulation or proxemic norm violations.</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="54-policy-and-legal-integration">5.4 Policy and Legal Integration</h3> <p>The EWP can be integrated into existing legal frameworks through:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Amendment of the EU AI Act Risk Categories</strong> – Introduce an “Embodiment Weight” multiplier in Article 6 risk classification, where embodied AI systems automatically receive an elevated risk score for safety, privacy, and autonomy concerns (European Union, 2024).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>ISO and IEEE Standards</strong> – Incorporate EWP metrics into ISO 13482 revisions and IEEE’s <em>Ethically Aligned Design</em> to address embodiment-specific affordances and hazards (IEEE, 2019).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Civil Liability Reform</strong> – Adopt an “embodiment-enhanced liability” principle, assigning stricter liability for harm caused by EAI, given its physical capacity to cause injury and its social capacity to manipulate through bodily presence (Pagallo, 2013).</p> </li> </ol> <hr> <h3 id="55-ethical-implications-and-future-research">5.5 Ethical Implications and Future Research</h3> <p>The EWP reframes AI ethics from a predominantly informational paradigm to a <strong>corporeal–relational paradigm</strong>. It challenges the implicit assumption that physicality in AI is merely a technical feature, instead positioning embodiment as an ethically <em>salient</em> dimension that modulates risk, responsibility, and relationality.</p> <p>Future research should explore:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The cross-cultural variability in embodied risk perception, especially in proxemics and haptic norms (Li et al., 2021).</p> </li> <li> <p>Longitudinal effects of sustained human–EAI cohabitation on social trust, empathy, and interhuman solidarity (Sparrow &amp; Sparrow, 2006).</p> </li> <li> <p>The philosophical limits of substituting human relational roles with embodied AI, particularly in care and education contexts.</p> </li> </ul> <hr> <p><strong>References (for this section)</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Bryson, J.

Conclusion and Future Directions</strong></h2> <h3 id="61-conclusion"><strong>6.1 Conclusion</strong></h3> <p>This study has advanced a phenomenological and body-philosophical account of embodied artificial intelligence (EAI), framing it not merely as a technological innovation but as a transformation of <em>being-in-the-world</em>. Drawing upon Merleau-Ponty’s <em>corps propre</em>, Heidegger’s <em>Mitsein</em>, and postphenomenological mediation theory, we have argued that embodiment constitutes a distinct ethical vector—one that fundamentally alters the modalities of risk, responsibility, and relationality in AI systems.</p> <p>Existing AI ethics frameworks remain predominantly informational in orientation, focusing on data integrity, algorithmic transparency, and fairness metrics. While these concerns are indispensable, they are insufficient for capturing the full scope of ethical implications posed by EAI. The physical instantiation of AI introduces new forms of interaction—spatial proximity, haptic feedback, gaze coordination—that can reshape trust, influence decision-making, and impact physical safety.</p> <p>The proposed <strong>Embodiment-Weighted Principle (EWP)</strong> responds to this normative gap by introducing an evaluative structure that integrates embodiment-specific metrics—E-HRI, E-Explain, and E-Trace—into governance protocols. This principle offers both conceptual clarity and operational feasibility, enabling regulators, designers, and ethicists to more accurately assess and manage the ethical risks of embodied systems. By linking phenomenological insight to policy-oriented design, the EWP bridges the current divide between philosophical analysis and regulatory practice.</p> <p>From a broader philosophical perspective, EAI challenges us to reconsider the boundaries between human and technological agency, raising questions about authenticity, relational reciprocity, and the ontological status of non-human actors in shared social spaces. The ethical challenge is not simply to prevent harm, but to ensure that the mutual shaping of humans and AI preserves the integrity of human-world relations in ways that are transparent, just, and respectful of embodied experience.</p> <hr> <h3 id="62-future-research-directions"><strong>6.2 Future Research Directions</strong></h3> <p>Several avenues warrant further scholarly and empirical exploration:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Cross-Cultural Ethics of Embodiment</strong> – Proxemic norms, haptic interaction rules, and trust calibration differ significantly across cultures. Comparative phenomenological studies could reveal culturally specific embodiment risks and inform adaptive governance models.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Longitudinal Impact Studies</strong> – The ethical evaluation of EAI should extend beyond initial deployment to examine how sustained interaction affects empathy, social trust, and human–human relations over months or years.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Integration of Real-Time Biometric Feedback</strong> – Incorporating physiological indicators (e.g., heart rate variability, galvanic skin response) into E-HRI assessments may enable dynamic risk weighting, allowing systems to adjust behavior in real time to mitigate stress or discomfort.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Co-Design with Stakeholders</strong> – Including users, caregivers, and affected communities in the design and governance of EAI could surface tacit ethical concerns that escape top-down regulatory approaches.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Philosophical Limits of Role Substitution</strong> – There is an urgent need to interrogate the ethical limits of replacing human relational roles—such as teaching, caregiving, and companionship—with embodied AI, especially in contexts involving vulnerable populations.</p> </li> </ol> <hr> <p><strong>Final Reflection (academic tone)</strong></p> <p>The trajectory from <em>Dasein</em> to embodied AI is not merely a narrative of technological progress; it is an ontological reconfiguration of the human condition. As EAI systems increasingly share our spaces, rhythms, and gestures, they become participants in the lifeworld, shaping the conditions under which meaning is constituted and shared. The governance of such systems must therefore move beyond technical compliance to embrace a richer, body-sensitive ethics—one that recognizes the human as an embodied being and the AI as an embodied other.</p> <p>If the history of technology has taught us anything, it is that the most profound transformations are not always those that operate at the level of machinery, but those that reconfigure our shared horizons of existence. Embodied AI stands precisely at this threshold, demanding an ethics that is as attentive to lived experience as it is to formal rules. The Embodiment-Weighted Principle is a first step toward meeting this challenge, offering a framework that is both philosophically grounded and pragmatically actionable.</p> <hr> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Baiyang 张柏阳 Zhang.

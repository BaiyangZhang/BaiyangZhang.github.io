Some background: My postdoc supervisor is Prof. B, a European working in China. In China, before you finish a postdoc you need to give an exit presentation. After that, people rate you, and then the committee signs their names on a document agreeing that you have completed the postdoc. The supervisor must be present. I just gave my exit presentation yesterday. It was supposed to be just a formality, but because Prof. B is… well, Prof. B, of course he had other ideas.

So, I gave my postdoc exit presentation in Chinese. Three minutes in, Prof. B began his show, questioning the authenticity of my papers. One of the papers I listed has been accepted by _Computers in Biology and Medicine_. He asked whether it was on arXiv. I said no. He asked why. I explained that, first, I don’t have the permission yet to upload papers in biostatistics and still looking for someone to sponsor me. Second, in biostatistics it is not required to post papers on arXiv before submission. Prof. B must not have understood, because he repeated: “Why are they not on arXiv? Papers must be on arXiv. You say you have these papers but you don’t have proof.” I said, very calmly, that I understood why he was asking, since we are all used to reading and sharing papers on arXiv, but in biostatistics they follow a different tradition. He insisted that if the papers were not on arXiv, they weren’t real. I replied that I would be happy to provide evidence of publication. He ignored everything I said, repeated himself for the third time, and practically called me a liar. I was about to show him the evidence, searching my inbox for confirmation emails, when another vice dean, Tang, intervened and said, “Let’s just move on.” Prof. B shut up, for the moment.

A few pages later, while I was introducing the model, he interrupted again: “This is someone else’s result. What is your contribution?” WTF? Don’t we all start presentations with some background? But Dean Tang said, “Just show us your own result.” So I had to skip four or five slides and jump to the final results. I briefly listed three projects. I was given about five minutes for each. He trashed every single one. The work I did with Jarah (another professor I’ve co-published with) was, according to Prof. B, all Jarah’s work and my contribution was zero. He interrupted me multiple times to emphasize that. I said it was group work: Jarah came up with the main idea, undoubtedly, but everyone in the group contributed. My project on biostatistics? Fake paper, not on arXiv. The project on emergent dimensions? Old work from when I was in the States, nothing to do with my postdoc here (though I am first author and my current university is the first affiliation).

Unfortunately, I need his signature as the final step. After the talk, there were two speakers, and our last task was to collect signatures from the committee. So I went to Prof. B, very politely: “Hi Prof. B, I need your signature here.”  
Prof. B (looking disgusted): “Ahh. For what? I can't sign it, you didn’t present any results. You can’t just show up and not show results.”  
Me: “I showed up, and I did (show my results).”  
B: “OK. Then pay me your flight ticket back. Han said you should pay your air ticket. Flight tickets, fifty thousand. I used my money.”

Before I came to China, they promised to reimburse me for the flight ticket. It was even written in the contract. This Mr. Han is the Dean of the School of Mathematics, in theory he is the most powerful guy in the department.

I was taken aback by the sudden shift to flight tickets and didn’t know what to say for a few seconds.

Prof. B: “Now you have a grant, three hundred thousand.” 
Me: “You’re saying Han told you that I should pay for the airplane ticket?”  
B: “Yes, he told me! I wasn’t supposed to give you this reimbursement.”  
Me: “That’s not what you told me when I came here.”  
B: “That was a mistake! You are not allowed to receive that money!”  
Me (calmly): “Not my mistake.”  
B: “Han said you should pay it back with that money.” 
Me: “I guess I should talk to Han, then.”

He got even more angry and said, “OK, let’s go talk about it!” So we went to Dean Han’s office. The door was locked; Han wasn’t there. Prof. B started ranting again about the money, while I insisted I wasn’t paying. After a while, he stormed back to the conference room. Dean Yang was still there. Prof. B strode up to Yang’s face and said, in his characteristic broken Chinese, “I paid for his (pointing at me) flight ticket and he refuses to pay me back!” 
Yang (stepping back): “I don’t know. How did you two agree?” And as Prof. B kept talking, Yang just slid away… honestly a little funny to watch. Then Prof. B stormed up to me: “Maybe I’ll call the police! Let them arrest you!” I said, “Yes, call the police, please. Let’s sort everything out.” He pulled out his phone and pretended to pressed on the screen, the screen wasn’t even unlocked. Then he stormed off again and disappeared. I went with the other speaker to buy a bottle of Diet Coke.

I checked my postdoc contract again, with all the signatures and stamps. It clearly says: 1) The University will provide 60k as a start-up research grant. 2) The supervisor will provide 60k for flight and quarantine from grant #CX3071A0360001. I am quite sure I have the high ground here.

I printed the contract, highlighted the part about the flight being paid by the supervisor, and went to Han’s office. The door was half-open, and I heard Prof. B ranting inside, saying things like “BaiYang… pay… flight ticket,” while Han muttered “yeah, yeah, you’re right.” I got angry for the first time, knocked and entered without waiting. I ignored Prof. B, went straight to Han, and showed him the contract. I started to explain, but Han interrupted me, quite rudely: “What do you want then?” I said, “Prof. B refuses to sign until I pay for the tickets. I will not pay.” Han said, “Then have you finished your duty according to the contract?” What a diversion! What the fuck does that have to do with the ticket? I said I’d won a national grant, published in top journals, and so on, I considered my tasks completed. Han said, “It doesn’t matter what you think, it’s what we think.” I said, “What about the flight ticket? Do I still have to pay?” My tone was flat, but I was furious, speaking faster than usual, can't help it. Han seemed out of bullshit, he said, “Don’t come to me, talk to Dean Yang, it’s his thing.” I said, “What if Dean Yang told me to come to you?” Han repeated, “Dean Yang won't say that. You don’t talk to me, you talk to Yang, and Yang talks to me.” A perfect display of hierarchy. I said, “According to the contract, if consultation fails, the matter shall be submitted to arbitration. Let’s go to arbitration.” Han stared at me through his foggy glasses and said, “You go talk to Yang.” I said, “You are being exceptionally clear. I’ll go talk to Yang right now,” and walked out. Throughout this, Prof. B just stood there like a stump—maybe his Chinese wasn’t good enough to keep up.

Afterwards, I had a quite normal, even pleasant conversation with Dean Yang. He looked at the contract and said it was quite clear. We chatted for half an hour. In the middle, he said I should have communicated more with Prof. B. I said, “Dean Yang, respectfully, you saw what Prof. B was like this afternoon. Imagine him being like that every time we argued, for the past two years. I really have tried.” Yang nodded. If things go well, I guess he’ll push Prof. B to sign, and finally I’ll be free of this nest of vipers. All my good friends have either already left or are leaving anyway.

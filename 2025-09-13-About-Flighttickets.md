Some background: My postdoc supervisor is Prof. Jakerb, a European working in China, very bitter person, has serious vulnerable NPD (my diagnosis) issues. In China, before you leave Postdoc you need to give an exit presentation, then people rate you, then the committee sign their names on the paper saying they agree to let you finish the postdoc. The supervisor must be present. And, I just gave my exit presentation yesterday. It was supposed to be a pure bureaucratic, formal thing, but because Bjarke is so..... Jakerb, noooo he had other ideas.

So, I just gave my Postdoc exit presentation in Chinese, Jakerb began his show 3 minutes in, started to question the authenticity of my papers. One of the paper I listed is accepted by *Computers in biology and medicine*, he asked is it on arXiv, I said no, he asked why, I explained, for two reasons, first I don't have the permission to put papers in biostatistics, I am still looking for someone to sponsor me, second in biostatistics it is not required to put you paper on arXiv before submitting it. Jakerb mustn't have understood, he said, why are they not on arXiv? Papers must be on arXiv, you say you have these papers but you don't have proof. I said, very calmly, I understand why you are asking it, since we are all used to reading and sharing papers via arXiv, but in biostatistics they follow different tradition. He insists that if they are not on arXiv, they are not real papers, I said I will be happy to provide the evidence of publication. Jakerb just ignored everything I've said, repeated himself for the third time, and practically called me a liar. I was about to show him the evidence, started to search my inbox for confirmation emails, another vice Dean Tang intervened and said, let’s just move on. Then Jakerb shut up, for now.

Then after another two pages, I was introducing the model, and he interrupted again, said this is someone else’s result, what is your contribution? WTF, don't we all start our presentations with some background? But Dean Tang said, just show us your own result. So I had to jump 4,5 slides to the final result. I listed three projects very briefly, I was given about 5 minutes for each project only. He literally trashed on everyone of them. The work I did with Jarah (another professor with whom I had a few publications) was, according to Jakerb, all Jarah’s work, my contribution is zero. He interrupted me a few times to emphasize that. I said it’s group work, Jarah came out with the main idea undoubtedly, but everyone in the group contributed. The project on biostatistics, fake paper, not on arXiv. The project on the emergent dimension, it was old work from when I was in the States, nothing to do with my postdoc here(although I am the first author and my current university is the first affiliation).

Unfortunately I need his signature as the last step, that's what I did after the talk. There were in total two speakers, our last task is to collect the signatures from the committee. So I said to Jakerb, very politely, Hi Jakerb, I need you signature here. 
Jakerb: **looks disgusted** Ahh. For what? I can sign it, you didn't present any results. You can't just show up and not show results.
Me: I showed up and I did (show my results).
B: OK. then pay my... pay your ticket back. Z said you should pay your air ticket. Flight tickets, fifty thousand. Used my money. 

Before I came to China, they promised that they will reimburse for the flight ticket. It was even written in the contract. And this "Z" guy is the Dean of the school of mathematics, he is more of a bureaucrat tZ a mathematician, very good at shifting responsibilities. Z will appear again later. 

I was taken by surprise by the sudden shift to flight tickets, didn't what to say for a few seconds.

Jakerb: Now you have grant, three thousand.
Me: You are saying Z told you that I should pay for the airplane ticket?
B: Yes he told me! I am not supposed to give you this... reimbursement.
Me: Oh that's not what you told me when I came here actually.
B: That was a mistake! You are not allow to receive that money!
Me: *calmly* Not my mistake.
B: Z said you should pay them back with that money.
I: I guess I should talk with Z then.

He was quite angry, said, OK let's go talk about it! So we went to Dean Z's office. The door was locked, he wasn't there. So Jakerb just starting ranting about the money again, where I insisted that I am not paying the flight ticket. After a while he stormed back to the conference room, Dean Ying was still there, Jakerb just strode to Ying's face, said to Ying, in his broken Chinese, "I paid for his (pointing at me) flight ticket and he refused to pay it back to me!"
Ying (step a step back): "I don't know, how did you agreed with each other?" and when Jakerb was mumbling something, Ying just slide away... It was actually a little funny to watch him doing that. Then Jakerb stormed to my face, said "Maybe I'll call the police!" I said, yes, call the police, please. Let's sort things out. He took out his cellphone, pressing on the screen, the screen was not even unlocked. Then he stormed off again and disappeared. So I went to the shop to buy a bottle of diet coke with the other speaker.
 
I have checked my postdoc contract again, with the signatures and stamps and everything. It clearly says: 1) The University will provide 60k as start up research grant, 2) The supervisor will provide 60K for flight and quarantine by grant #CX3071A0360001. I am pretty sure I have the high ground here. 

Right after I pulled up my contract, I printed it and highlighted the part where it says that the airplane ticket is supposed to be paid by the supervisor, and went to Z's office. The door was half-open and I can Jakerb inside ranting about me, I heard keywords like "BaiYing...pay" and "flight ticket", while Z was saying "yeah... yeah... you're right". I got a bit angry for the first time, knocked on the door and entered, without waiting for Z's "come in!". I totally ignored Jakerb, went to Z and showed him the contract. I started to explain the contract, but Z just interrupted me, quite rudely, and said, what do you want then? I said, Jakerb refuse to sign his name until I pay the flight tickets, I will not pay. Z said, then have you finished your duty according to the contract? What a swift diversion of topic! What the fuck does that has to do with the flight ticket? I said I've won a national grant and published on top journals and so on, I consider my task completed. Z said, it doesn't matter what you think, it's what we think. I said, then what about the flight ticket? Do I still have to pay? My tone was still flat, but I began to speak faster tZ usual, can't help it, I was furious. I think Z just run out of bullshit to say so he said, don't come to me, talk to Dean Ying, it's his thing. I said, what if Dean Ying had told me to come to you? Z said again, you don't talk to me, you talk to Dean Ying and he talks to me. What a clear Hierarchical system! At this point I wanted to punch his ugly fat face so badly, I looked into his eyes and said, "according to the contract, if consultation fails, the matter shall be submitted to arbitration. Let's submit it to arbitration. If I fail to meet the requirement of my contract, I'll take whatever punishment." Z stared me back from his thick, foggy glasses and said, you go and talk to Ying. I said, you are being exceptional clear, I'll go and talk to Ying right now. Then just walked out. During the entire time, Jakerb was just standing there like a stump, I don't know if it's his Chinese not good enough to cut in the conversation or what.

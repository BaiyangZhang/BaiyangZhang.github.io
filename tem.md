In Eq. (1.5) we have $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle_ {0}$, as far as I can tell $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle_ {0}$ here is used without introduction? To me it is fine, but is it gonna confuse the audience?




 1. is a squeezed state, $B_ {k}\left\lvert K \right\rangle=0 \;\forall \, k$;
 2. is a eigenstate of the Hamiltonian;
 3. reproduces the classical form factor, $\left\langle K \right\rvert\phi \left\lvert K \right\rangle=f_ {\text{kink}}$

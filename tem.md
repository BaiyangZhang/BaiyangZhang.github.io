Hi Hui,

This is done in Eq (38).  In the last equality, the substitute in for phi the classical solution, but using m and lambda.  This would be justified if you were acting on a phi eigenstate whose eigenvalues are the classical solution using the renormalized parameters.  But here it is suspicious for many reasons, including:

1) The soliton is BPS, so the kinetic and potential energies should be the same.  So why shift just the potential energy?

2) Why m and lambda?  Maybe if they imposed the no-tadpole condition, the renormalized m and lambda would somehow give the right solution , but under (32) they write "without the no-tadpole condition".

3) If there is a subleading correction to the solution, then you got a contribution by plugging it into the leading part of the Hamiltonian.  It will be of the same order as (38), which is the leading solution in the subleading Hamiltonian.

Their big claim, you can see on Table IV.  The answer E_ELZ is made by adding the scheme-independent result from the first line of tables 1 and 2 to the DeltaE_CT column, which is eq (38).  So thee only affect that the scheme has on the mass is Eq (38).  So it also hinges on (38) and in particular on which phi(x) you should plug into (38) ... also there is the question of whether subleading corrections to the solution change the answers in Tables I and II ...

There may be some symmetry group $G$ acting on the Lagrangian. The theory can be separated into free part and interacting part. Upon quantization, the interaction will introduce an UV energy scale $\Lambda_ {\text{UV}}$ above which the theory becomes invalid. The symmetry group $G$ might break, if it is solely due to the quantization procedure then we say the symmetry is anomalous. The classical Hamiltonian are functions of canonical variables $q$ and $p$. The canonical variables satisfy certain Poisson brackets, which generates the dynamics of the model.</p> <p>Let’s ignore the interaction for now and deal with a free theory only. We will introduce interaction later and see that they cause fundamental difficulties in quantization. But without interaction, things are under control. To quantize a classical model we need to construct a Hilbert space in a self-consistent way. The simplest procedure is to upgrade the generalized coordinates and canonical momenta to operators, then map the Poisson bracket to the so-called canonical commutation relation (CCR),</p> \[[q,p] = i\hbar.\] <p>The Hilbert space we are looking for is a representation of CCR. there exist different possible representations, for example $q,p$ could be represented by matrices; or we could let $q=q$ and $p=-i\hbar \frac{ \partial }{ \partial q }$, the corresponding Hilbert space is the Lebesgue space $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$, which is the square-integrable functions quotient functions with measure zero almost everywhere, such as the famous Dirichlet function.</p> <p>Classical functions $f(q,p)$ are quantized in a straightforward way, by replacing $q$ and $p$ by their corresponding operators.</p> <p>This procedure has a number of problems. For example, it is not consistent in the sense that the quantization of $f(q,p)$ is usually not unique due to different orders of $p,q$. Later people proposed better, more sophisticated quantization methods, such as geometry quantization and deformation quantization. So it is safe to say that, given a free classical theory, we can quantize it to obtain a Hilbert space for free quantum theory.</p> <p>Given a CCR there exist multiple irreducible representations, so the question is, are they unitarily equivalent to each other, that is, do they give the same physical results? In quantum mechanics we deal with finite dimensional CCR and this question is answered by the Stone-von Neumann theorem, which claims that all the representations are equivalent up to a unitary transform. This makes sure that whatever representation we choose, we will get the same prediction for observables. However, it turned out later that if $U(1)$ gauge field is included, this claim is no longer true. I am still not sure about this claim, but it seems to suggest that even in the finite dimensional case, a single irreducible representation, up to unitary transform, is already not enough when there is electro-magnetic field around.</p> <hr/> <p>One way to think of the quantization of quantum field theory is to start from quantum mechanics, generalize $p$ and $q$ to $\phi(\vec{x})$ and $\pi(\vec{x})$, going from finite dimensional CCR of quantum mechanics to infinite dimensional CCR of quantum field theory. This way we start from a well-established CCR algebra and generalize its dimension to infinity. Another way is to start from a classical field theory, say, a scalar classical Landau-Ginsberg model, with real scalar field $\phi(\vec{x})$. Let $M$ be the space manifold, the configuration space of a classical field theory is denoted as $\mathcal{C}(M,\mathbb{R})$ where $\mathbb{R}$ is the time direction. Regard $\vec{x}$ as continuous indices as in quantum field theory, then $\vec{x}$ labels different field operator, and each $\phi(\vec{x})$ can be considered as a functional, it is the evaluation functional on the configuration space, explicitly let $f\in\mathcal{C}$ then</p> \[\phi(\vec{x}): \mathcal{C} \to \mathbb{R},\quad f \mapsto f(\vec{x}).\] <p>A general field is a function $F$ of the basic field $\phi$, $F=F(\phi)$. Then $F(\phi)$ is also a functional on $\mathcal{C}$. The advantage of this point of view is that, first, in particular in view of deformation quantization, it is a main advantage of our approach that the fields of both the classical and the quantum theory are defined in terms of the same space of functionals. Second, many of the most fundamental and profound phenomenon in quantum field theory, such as renormalization group flow or critical behavior, already takes place in classical field theory level. This approach greatly increases our understanding of quantum field theory.</p> <p>For quantum field theory, we can borrow the Hilbert space constructed in quantum mechanics and expand it to Fock space, sometimes know as second quantization. Compare to coming up to a Hilbert space from nothing, the construction of Fock space is quite straight forward, that’s why Edward Nelson said something like the first quantization is a mystery and the second quantization is a functor.</p> <p>However, recall that this Fock space is built up from free states, there is no interaction involved yet. The eigen states are supposed to be that of free particles with mass $m$, whose energy is $\sqrt{\vec{p}^{2}+m^{2}}$. To deal with interaction, the standard procedure is to turn to interaction picture, or Dirac picture. In interaction picture, the operators are evolved by free Hamiltonian without interaction, and the states alone are evolved by interact. This allows us to easily write down the time dependence of field operators, then it is easy to write down the Feynman propagators, etc.</p> <p>There are some fundamental issues regarding the good old interaction picture that I haven’t figured out, and I mean the so-called Haag’s theorem, or more accurately Haag-Hall-Wightman (HHW) theorem, which roughly says that interaction picture is inconsistent, even in the case of neutral free scalar field with different masses. <strong>It claims that the set of assumptions required to construct the interaction picture is only consistent when there is no interaction.</strong> It also claims that <strong>non-Fock representations have an important rule to play in QFT</strong> (Earman and Fraser, 2006). Our work on kinks will provide an explicit example.</p> <hr/> <p>As we mentioned before, quantum theories, no matter quantum field theory or quantum field theory are described by a bunch of canonical commutation relations (here we only consider bosonic case), such as $[x,p]=i\hbar$ or $[\phi(\vec{x}),\pi(\vec{y})]=(2\pi)^{d}\delta^{d}(\vec{x}-\vec{y})$. In quantum mechanics we have finite sets of independent CCR’s (canonical commutation relation), while in quantum field theory we have infinite dimension. Things usually get quite messy when going from finite to infinity, properties that hold in the finite case may not hold for infinite case, for example a sum of finite positive numbers are always positive, but a sum of infinite positive numbers may not be positive anymore. The same thing happens with going from quantum mechanics to quantum field theory.</p> <h1 id="haag-hall-wightman-theorem">Haag-Hall-Wightman theorem</h1> <p>Fock space is only one representation among an uncountable infinity of Hilbert space representations (Garding &amp; Wightman, 1954). So why Fock representation? Haag was motivated by this choice question to formulate his theorem. Later turns out that there exists so-called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strange representation</code>, which by definition is any representation of free field that is unitarily inequivalent form Fock space. <strong>The determination of representation is a dynamical problem.</strong> Like Florig and Summers (2000) said,</p> <blockquote> <p>The kinematical aspects determine the choice of CCR-algebra, whereas the dynamics fix the choice of the representation.</p> </blockquote> <hr/> <p>The vacuum state can be specified in two ways: (1) it is the minimal energy state; (2) it is the unique state annihilated by particle number operator $a^{\dagger}a$. If these two specification don’t coincide, the vacuum is said to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polarized</code>. As we will see later, <strong>the presence of a kink will polarize the trivial vacuum</strong>. <strong>Vacuum polarization lies at the core of HHW theorem, any interacting quantum field operator, or free fields of different masses, polarizes the vacuum</strong>.</p> <p>Back to the equal time CCR (canonical commutation relation), which is roughly</p> \[[\phi(\vec{x}),\pi(\vec{x})]=i\delta^{3}(\vec{x}-\vec{x}'), \quad 0 \text{ otherwise.}\] <p>Sometimes the field operator $\phi$ and $\pi$ are “smeared” in space, namely integrated against some controlled functions $f$</p> \[\phi(f) := \int d^{3}x \, f(\vec{x})\phi(\vec{x})\] <p>so that quantities of interest are well defined. $f$ is called the test function. For example, we can smear the field to get rid of the Dirac delta function if necessary, and we get</p> \[[\phi(f),\pi(g)] = \left\langle f,g \right\rangle\] <p>where $\left\langle f,g \right\rangle$ is the inner product of $f$ and $g$. Even though we are not gonna use this “regularized” commutation relation here, it is useful to know this trick.</p> <p><strong>Here should put a short mathematical explanation of the gist of Haag’s theorem.</strong></p> <p>HHW theorem does not imply that it’s impossible to treat interactions in the standard way (such as that adopted in Peskin&amp;Schroeder), it just has to be unitarily inequivalent to the free Fock space. The HHW theorem shows that, a single, universal Hilbert space representation does not suffice for describing both free and interacting fields. Instead, unitarily inequivalent representations must be employed.</p> <p><strong>Put the example in $\phi^{4}_ {1+1}$ example by Jaffe.</strong></p> <hr/> <p>With the reasons stated above, in our calculation we will adopt Schrodinger’s picture instead of standard interaction picture.</p> <h1 id="vacuum-sector-of-quantum-theory">Vacuum sector of quantum theory</h1> <p>We will work in Schrodinger picture, where operators are dependent on position only. From time to time we will come back to interaction picture as a consistency check. We will only consider real scalar field $\phi$ in $d+1$ dimension. In Schrodinger picture, a generic operator $\mathcal{O}(\phi(\vec{x}),\pi(\vec{x}))$ is given as a function of the field $\phi(\vec{x})$ and the canonical momentum density $\pi(\vec{x})$, where $\vec{x}$ is the spatial coordinate. Note that since it is not the interaction picture, we don’t deal with the Lorentz covariant four-vector $x^{\mu}$.</p> <p>Without loss of generality, we take phi-fourth theory for example, denoted $\phi^{4}_ {d+1}$. What we do to phi-fourth theory can be done to any potential. The Hamiltonian is normal ordered at mass scale $m_ {0}$, which is the bare mass of the free particle. Normal-ordering is regarded by me as a part of the definition of the theory, different people might have different views. Naturally people might ask, why normal order at the bare mass, not the renormalized mass $m$? Well, it doesn’t matter what mass scale we choose, after renormalization the ambiguity introduced by the mass scale is fixed by the renormalization conditions, and the observables are independent of this choice.</p> <p>There is a $\mathbb{Z}_ {2}$ symmetry of the Hamiltonian which breaks spontaneously. The Hamiltonian before the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) reads:</p> \[\begin{align*} \hat{H}(\vec{x}) &amp;= \int d^{d}x: \hat{\mathcal{H}}(\vec{x}) :_ {m_ {0}} \\ \hat{\mathcal{H}}(\vec{x}) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(\pi(\vec{x})^{2}+(\partial_ {i}\phi(\vec{x})^{2}) - \frac{1}{4}m_ {0}^{2}\phi^{2} + \frac{\lambda_ {0}}{4}\phi^{4}+A. \end{align*}\] <p>We use the convention that parameters with a naught downstairs represent the bare parameters. $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian before the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB).</p> <p>To be more specific, the Hamiltonian undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking since the minimum of the Hamiltonian is obtained at $\phi=\pm v_ {0}$ where $v_ {0}=\frac{m_ {0}}{\sqrt{2\lambda_ {0}}}$. Later we will shift the field operator from $\phi$ to $\phi’$, so that the vacuum is obtained at $\phi’=0$, the Hamiltonian in terms of $\phi’$ is denoted $H$ without hat. Note the factor $-m_ {0}^{2} /4$ in the mass term, we have $\frac{1}{4}$ instead of $\frac{1}{2}$ so that in the symmetry broken phase the particle has a canonical mass term. The last $A$ in the Hamiltonian is a c-number that cancels the zero point energy in the vacuum sector. We also define coupling $g_ {0}$ as</p> \[g_ {0}^{2} := \lambda_ {0}.\] <p>The reason why we introduce a new symbol $g$ for $\sqrt{\lambda}$ is that, when we do calculations in the symmetry broken phase, we will be directly dealing with $\sqrt{\lambda}$ and define it to be $g$ just makes sense.</p> <p>In the Schrodinger picture, the field operator and canonical momentum operator can be decomposed in terms of plane waves as usual,</p> \[\phi(\vec{x}) = \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \omega_ {p} }} (a_ {p} \, e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} } + a^{\dagger}_ {p}\,e^{ -i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} }).\] <p>The canonical commutation relation reads</p> \[[a_ {p},a^{\dagger}_ {k}] = (2\pi)^{d}\delta^{d}(\vec{p}-\vec{k}).\] <p>But $a_ {p}$ and $a_ {p} ^{\dagger}$ are not Lorentz invariant, so we decided to introduce a Lorentz version:</p> \[\phi(\vec{x}) = \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \frac{1}{2 \omega_ {p} } (A_ {p} \, e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} } + A^{\dagger}_ {p}\,e^{ -i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} }).\] <p>The price to pay is that $A,A^{\dagger}$ no longer satisfy CCR. We can fix that by defining $A^{\ddagger}:= A^{\dagger} / 2\omega _ {p}$, then $A$ and $A^{\ddagger}$ satisfy CCR. In summary we have</p> \[\boxed{ \begin{align*} A_ {p} &amp;\equiv \sqrt{ 2\omega_ {p} }\,a_ {p},\quad A^{\dagger}_ {p} \equiv \sqrt{ 2\omega_ {p} }\,a^{\dagger}_ {p}, \\ A^{\ddagger}_ {p} &amp;:= \frac{A^{\dagger}_ {p}}{2\omega_ {p}} = \frac{a^{\dagger}_ {p}}{\sqrt{ 2\omega_ {p} }}, \\ [A_ {p},A^{\ddagger}_ {k}] &amp;= (2\pi)^{d}\,\delta^{d}(\vec{p}-\vec{k}). \end{align*} }\] <hr/> <p>The renormalized quantities are define as</p> \[m^{2}=m_ {0}^{2} + \delta m^{2}, \quad \sqrt{ \lambda } = \sqrt{ \lambda_ {0} } + \delta \sqrt{ \lambda }.\] <p>or equivalently</p> \[g = g_ {0} + \delta g.\] <p>We also define $v$ to be the vev of $\phi$ in broken vacuum:</p> \[v = \frac{m}{\sqrt{ 2\lambda }} + \delta v.\] <p>All the counter terms can be perturbatively expanded:</p> \[\begin{align*} \delta m^{2}&amp; =\sum_ {i=1}^{\infty} \delta m^{2}_ {i} , \quad \delta m^{2}_ {i}\sim \mathcal{O}(g^{i+1}), \\ \delta g &amp;= \sum_ {i=1}^{\infty} \delta g_ {i}, \quad \delta g_ {i} \sim \mathcal{O}(g^{i+2}),\\ H &amp;= \sum_ {i=0}^{\infty} H_ {i},\quad H_ {i} \sim \mathcal{O}(g^{i-2}) , \\ A &amp;= \sum_ {i=0}^{\infty}A_ {i}, \quad A_ {i} \sim \mathcal{O}(g^{i-2}) , \\ \delta v &amp;= \sum_ {i=1}^{\infty} \delta v_ {i} ,\quad \delta v_ {i} \sim \mathcal{O}(g^{i}), \\ \left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle &amp;= \sum_ {i=0}^{\infty} \left\lvert{\Psi_ {i}}\right\rangle , \quad \left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle _ {i} \sim \mathcal{O}(g^{i}), \\ I &amp;\sim \mathcal{O}(g^{2}). \end{align*}\] <p>Where $I$ is some variable which will be define later, I put it here for the sake of completeness.</p> <h2 id="normal-ordering-revisited">Normal ordering revisited</h2> <p>Reference: Sidney Coleman’s <a href="http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/%7Ekamecke/ps/coleman.pdf">1975 paper</a> and his lecture note title <em>Aspects of Symmetry</em>, the chapter about classical and quantum lumps.</p> <p>In Coleman’s 1975 paper, he studied the sine-Gordon model</p> \[\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_ {\mu}\phi)^{2} + \frac{\alpha_ {0}}{\beta^{2}}\cos \beta \phi+\gamma_ {0}\] <p>and famously pointed out:</p> <ol> <li>As for any theory of a <strong>scalar field</strong> with <strong>nonderivative interaction</strong> in <strong>2 dimensional spacetime</strong>, normal ordering the Hamiltonian alone is enough to cancel all the divergences at any loop order;</li> <li>If the $\beta$-parameter exceeds $8\pi$, the Hamiltonian density is not bounded below.</li> <li>If $\beta&lt;8\pi$, the model is equivalent to the charge-zero sector of almost-massive Thirring model.</li> <li>The fermion in the Thirring model is massless if $\beta=4\pi$.</li> </ol> <p>Well, point 2,3 and 4 are not relevant to our discussion, I just put it here for the sake of completeness. My point is, turns out there is more to normal ordering than I thought. In textbooks such that by Peskin&amp;Schroeder, or Mark Srednicki, normal ordering is regarded as a simple, if not trivial, ad hoc procedure that puts all the creation operators to the left of all the annihilation operators in order to eliminate the zero point energy of the trivial vacuum, and it was only done to the free part of the Hamiltonian. But when also applied to higher degree polynomial, the normal ordering can also generate counter terms. For example, normal ordering the $\phi^{4}$ term will generate a counter term for $\phi^{2}$ term. So I feel like it is necessary to revisit normal order.</p> <p>The defining property of normal ordering is that expectation values of normal-ordered operators vanish in the free theory:</p> \[\left\langle{0}\right\rvert : \mathcal{O} :\left\lvert{0}\right\rangle =0\] <p>for any operator $\mathcal{O}$ and free vacuum $\left\lvert{0}\right\rangle$. There are various formulations of this notion <sup id="fnref:Polchinski"><a href="#fn:Polchinski" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> , such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">creation-annihilation operator normal ordering</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conformal normal ordering</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">functional integral normal ordering</code>, etc. In this note we will only talk about creation-annihilation operator normal ordering.</p> <p>What is less often discussed is that normal ordering also depends on a mass scale mmm. In most cases, it is quite clear which value of mmm to choose, typically the mass of the free particle, known as the free mass. However, to determine what the free mass is, we first need to know the form of the Hamiltonian. For example if we can unambiguously separate the Hamiltonian into $\mathcal{H}_ {0}+U(\phi)$, where $\mathcal{H}_ {0}=\pi^{2} / 2+(\partial_ {x}\phi)^{2} /2+m^{2}\phi^{2} /2$, then $m$ is the free mass. Sometimes, however, the situation is more complex. For instance, it may be more convenient to include $m^{2}\phi^{2} /2$ in the interaction term, as in the case of sine-Gordon model. In this case, the free Hamiltonian only contains the kinetic part, and the free particle appears massless. In general, for a quadratic term of the form $a \phi^2$, where $a$ is a real parameter, we can choose how much of it goes into the free Hamiltonian, with the remainder contributing to the interaction. For example, we can pick a number such as $m_ {e}=0.511$ MeV and say that $m_ {e}^{2}\phi^{2}/2$ goes to the free Hamiltonian, such that the free particle has mass $m_ {e}$, then $(a-\frac{m^{2}}{2})\phi^{2}$ will go to the interaction. This is just a matter of convenience, the observables should not depend on such arbitrary choices.</p> <p>So, how does all this relate to normal ordering? Normal ordering is a procedure that rearranges creation and annihilation operators, and these operators inherently depend on the free mass of the particle. $a^{\dagger}_ {p}$ creates a particle of momentum $\vec{p}$ <strong>with mass $m$</strong>, the energy of the particle is $\sqrt{ \vec{p}^{2}+m^{2} }$. I repeat, <strong>the choice of $m$ depends on what you choose to call the free Hamiltonian, and that choice is somehow arbitrary.</strong> The result of changing $m$ can be absorbed in a redefinition of the theory parameters.</p> <p>My assumption is, the field operator $\phi(x)$ itself is independent of the aforementioned choice of mass parameter $m$, while the stuff that do depend on $m$ are</p> <ol> <li>creation and annihilation operators $a_ {p,m}$ and $a^{\dagger}_ {p,m}$,</li> <li>the energy $\omega=\sqrt{ \vec{p}^{2}+m^{2} }$, we will write it as $\omega_ {p,m}$ explicitly,</li> <li>states in Fock space. For example, the free vacuum $\left\lvert{0,m}\right\rangle$ is by definition annihilated by $a_ {p,m}$. Since the states in the Fock space are constructed by applying $a^{\dagger}_ {p,m}$ consecutively, a re-definition of $a^{\dagger}_ {p,m}$ to, say $a^{\dagger}_ {p,\mu}$ will also change the states themselves.</li> </ol> <p>Recall that the field operator can be expanded in terms of energy and ladder operators,</p> \[\phi(\vec{x}) = \int \frac{d^{d}k}{(2\pi)^{d}}\, \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2\omega_ {k,m} }} (a_ {k,m} \, e^{ i\vec{k}\cdot \vec{x} } + a^{\dagger}_ {k,m}\,e^{ -i\vec{k}\cdot \vec{x} })\] <p>and the $m$-dependence in $\omega_ {k,m}$, $a_ {k,m}$ and $a^{\dagger}_ {k,m}$ should cancel out so that $\phi(\vec{x})$ itself is $m$-independent.</p> <hr/> <p>We can define the <strong>normal ordering at $m$</strong> by decomposing the Schrodinger picture fields and momenta into creation and annihilation part:</p> \[\begin{align*} \phi^{+}(\vec{x}) &amp;= \int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}} \, e^{ -i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} } A^{\ddagger}_ {p,m} \\ \phi^{-}(\vec{x}) &amp;= \int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}} \, e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} } \frac{A_ {p,m}}{2\omega_ {p,m}}, \end{align*}\] <p>similarly for the canonical momenta</p> \[\pi^{\pm }(\vec{x}) = \pm i\sqrt{ -\nabla^{2}+m^{2} }\phi^{\pm }(\vec{x}) ,\] <p>which implies</p> \[\begin{align*} \pi^{-}&amp;= - \frac{i}{2} \int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}} \, e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} } A_ {p,m} ,\\ \pi^{+} &amp;= i \int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}} \, e^{ -i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} } \omega_ {p,m}A^{\ddagger}_ {p,m} . \end{align*}\] <p>It is easy to verify that</p> \[\begin{align*} \phi(\vec{x}) &amp;= \phi^{+}(\vec{x}) + \phi^{-}(\vec{x}) , \\ \pi(\vec{x}) &amp;= \pi^{+}(\vec{x}) + \pi^{-}(\vec{x}) . \end{align*}\] <p>We can arrange a sting of field operators using the Wick’s theorem, which says that a string of product of field operators can be rewritten as the sum of all the possible contractions of operators, all of them normal ordered. For example,</p> \[\phi(\vec{x})\phi(\vec{x}) = :\phi(\vec{x})\phi(\vec{x}): + \text{ contraction}\left\lbrace \phi(\vec{x})\phi(\vec{x}) \right\rbrace .\] <p>The contraction is where different choice of $m$ generates different results. Let’s write the contraction at $m$ as $C_ {m}\left\lbrace \cdots \right\rbrace$, we have</p> \[\boxed{ \begin{align*} \phi^{2}(\vec{x}) &amp;= :\phi^{2}(\vec{x}):_ {m} + C_ {m}\left\lbrace \phi^{2}(\vec{x}) \right\rbrace , \\ C_ {m}\left\lbrace \phi^{2}(\vec{x}) \right\rbrace &amp;= [\phi^{-},\phi^{+}] = \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^{3}} \, \frac{1}{2\omega_ {p,m}}. \end{align*} }\] <p>Recall that $\phi^{2}$ is $m$-independent, while the normal ordering and the contraction are $m$-dependent. This gives us a means to connect normal ordering at different mass $m$ and $m_ {0}$, since</p> \[\phi^{2}(\vec{x}) = :\phi^{2}(\vec{x}):_ {m} + C_ {m}(\phi^{2}(\vec{x})) = :\phi^{2}(\vec{x}):_ {m_ {0}} + C_ {m_ {0}}(\phi^{2}(\vec{x})),\] <p>which implies that</p> \[\begin{align*} :\phi^{2}(\vec{x}):_ {m_ {0}} &amp;= :\phi^{2}(\vec{x}):_ {m} + C_ {m}-C_ {m_ {0}} \\ &amp;= :\phi^{2}(\vec{x}):_ {m} + \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}} \, \left( \frac{1}{\omega_ {p,m}} - \frac{1}{\omega_ {p,m_ {0}}} \right) . \end{align*}\] <p>where $C_ {m}$ is short for $C_ {m}(\phi^{2})$, a short-handed notation we will use extensively for the rest of the note. $C_ {m}$ is a c-number, usually given by a divergent integral.</p> <p>Similarly, we can get normal order all the terms in the Lagrangian at all the mass scales.

It seems to be of order $\lambda_ {0}I\sim \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{2})$, however, often times we need to replace the field operator $\phi$ by $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle+\phi’$, where $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle$ is the expectation valued for $\phi$ under certain circumstances, and it is usually of order $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle\sim 1 / g$ where $g\equiv \sqrt{ \lambda }$.

Given a function $f(\vec{x})$, the associated displacement operator is defined as</p> \[\mathcal{D}_ {f} := \exp \left\lbrace -i\pi(f) \right\rbrace , \quad \pi(f):=\int d^{3}x \, f(\vec{x})\pi(\vec{x}).\] <p>$\pi(f)$ is the <strong>smeared</strong> canonical momentum operator. This definition is similar to the space translation operator</p> \[T_ {\vec{x}} = \exp \left\lbrace -i\hat{P}\cdot \vec{x} \right\rbrace .\] <p>The translation operator changes the position, while the displacement operator changes the vev of the field operator itself. In other words, $T_ {\vec{x}}$ translates in the configuration space, while $\mathcal{D}_ {f}$ translates in the function space. To be more specific, we have</p> \[[\phi(\vec{x}),\mathcal{D}_ {f}] = e^{ -i\pi(f) } [\phi(\vec{x}),-i\pi(f)] =f(\vec{x}) \mathcal{D}_ {f},\] <p>hence</p> \[\mathcal{D} \phi \mathcal{D}^{\dagger}=\phi-f.\] <p>Since $\mathcal{D}_ {f}^{-1}=\mathcal{D}_ {-f}$, we have the following comparison:</p> \[\begin{align*} T_ {\vec{x}}^{\dagger}\, \phi(\vec{y})\, T_ {\vec{x}} &amp;= \phi(\vec{y}+\vec{x}),\\ \mathcal{D}_ {f} ^{\dagger} \, \phi(\vec{x})\, \mathcal{D}_ {f} &amp;= \phi(\vec{x})+f(\vec{x}). \end{align*}\] <p>The point is that <strong>we can use the unitary $\mathcal{D}_ {f}$ to translate the basis of the Hilbert space.</strong></p> <p>Compare $T_ {\vec{x}}$ and $\mathcal{D}_ {f}$. Let $\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$ be any state, the resulting state of $T_ {\vec{x}}$ acting on $\left\lvert \psi \right\rangle$, namely the state $T_ {\vec{x}}\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$, has two interpretations: the passive view and the active view. In the passive view, the translation is seen as a change to the coordinate system or reference frame, rather than a change to the state itself. The state of the system remains unchanged, but the coordinates used to describe it are shifted. In contrast, in the active view, the translation actively shifts the state, while the coordinate system remains the same. The coordinates stay fixed, but the state (or field configuration) changes.</p> <p>The same applies to the displacement operator $\mathcal{D}_ {f}$, given any state (now we are working in the context of quantum field theory, rather than quantum mechanics) $\left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle$, $\mathcal{D}_ {f}\left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle$ can be interpreted either as a new state (active perspective), or as the same state but in different basis (passive perspective).</p> <p>When it comes to the discussion about kink states and trivial vacuum states, my personal taste is to think of $\mathcal{D}_ {f}$ passively. This approach allows us to discuss the same states in different bases, or “frames”.</p> <p>$\mathcal{D}_ {f}$ “shifts” $\left\lvert{\varphi}\right\rangle$ by $f(\vec{x})$ as</p> \[\mathcal{D}_ {f}\left\lvert{h(\vec{x})}\right\rangle = \left\lvert{h(\vec{x})+f(\vec{x})}\right\rangle .\] <p>As you can verify, we also have</p> \[\left\langle{\Psi}\right\rvert \mathcal{D}_ {f}^{\dagger} \hat{\phi}(\vec{x}) \mathcal{D}_ {f}\left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle = \psi(\vec{x})+f(\vec{x}),\] <p>as we showed before. We can regard $\mathcal{D}_ {f}\left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle$ as the same state as $\left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle$, just measured with different basis: instead of $\left\langle \varphi \middle\vert \Psi \right\rangle$, we have $\left\langle \varphi+f \middle\vert \Psi \right\rangle$.</p> <hr/> <p>From the expansion</p> \[\phi(\vec{x}) = \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}\sqrt{2\omega_ {p}}} \, (a_ {p} e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} }+h.c.)\] <p>and $\mathcal{D}\phi \mathcal{D}^{\dagger}=\phi-f$, we can determine how $\mathcal{D}$ sandwiches $a_ {p}$:</p> \[\mathcal{D}_ {f} a_ {p} \mathcal{D}_ {f}^{\dagger} = a_ {p} - \widetilde{a}_ {p}\] <p>where $\widetilde{a}$ is the coefficient of the kink solution,</p> \[f(\vec{x}) = \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}\sqrt{2\omega _ {p} }} \, (\widetilde{a}_ {p}e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} }+\widetilde{a}_ {p}^\ast e^{ -i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} }) .\] <h2 id="field-operator-in-the-kink-sector">Field operator in the kink sector</h2> <p>In the language of Lagrangian or path integral, perturbation method is relatively straightforward. Consider the scalar $\phi^{4}$ theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking,</p> \[\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_ {\mu}\phi)^{2} + \frac{1}{4} m^{2} - \frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^{4}.\] <p>After the spontaneous symmetry breaking the vacuum is shifted from $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle=0$ to $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle= m / \sqrt{2\lambda}$. Now, we want to study the quantum fluctuation of real scalar field $\phi$ in the back ground $\phi=\frac{m}{\sqrt{2\lambda}}$, what we do is redefine the field operator as $\phi\to \frac{m }{\sqrt{ 2\lambda }}+\phi’$, so that the new vacuum is obtained at $\phi’$ equals zero. We treat $\phi’$ as the fundamental quantum field. The small fluctuation about $\frac{m }{\sqrt{ 2\lambda }}$ gives the quantum effects via partition function</p> \[Z[J] = \int D\phi' \, \exp \left\lbrace iS[\phi']+i \int \phi' J \right\rbrace ,\] <p>about $\phi’\sim 0$. We say that this partition function is perturbative about $\phi’=0$.</p> <hr/> <p>Above is in Lagrangian formalism, we know there is also Hamiltonian formalism, and anything that can be done with one formalism can equally be done in the other, it is just a matter of convenience.</p> <p>The fundamental idea is similar to the perturbative calculation we did in quantum mechanics, but generalized to quantum field theory. The key idea is that to perform the perturbation calculation about a state $\left\lvert \Psi \right\rangle$, we need to find the basic field operator $\phi’$ that has zero vev, $\left\langle \Psi \right\rvert\phi’\left\lvert \Psi \right\rangle=0$. Then and only then can we apply the standard perturbation method to $\phi’$ and $\left\lvert \Psi \right\rangle$.</p> <p>Turns out, the desired basic field operator $\phi’$ differs from the original field operator just by an unitary transformation, given by the displacement operator. Recall the defining property of displacement operator, $\mathcal{D}_ {f}^{\dagger}\phi \mathcal{D}_ {f}=\phi+f$.</p> <p>Let’s start with a trivial case. We know that the phi fourth model admits SSB. Assume we want to perform perturbative calculation in the symmetry broken phase $\left\lvert 0^{+} \right\rangle$, where the original field operator $\phi$ has vev $\left\langle 0^{+} \right\rvert \phi \left\lvert 0^{+} \right\rangle=-v$, where</p> \[v = -\frac{m }{\sqrt{ 2\lambda}}.\] <p>Use the displacement operator to transform $\phi$, we have (at least at leading order)</p> \[\left\langle{0^{+}}\right\rvert \mathcal{D}_ {v }^{\dagger} \phi \mathcal{D}_ {v }\left\lvert{0^{+}}\right\rangle = \left\langle{0^{+}}\right\rvert \phi+v \left\lvert{0^{+}}\right\rangle = \frac{m }{\sqrt{ 2\lambda }}-\frac{m }{\sqrt{ 2\lambda }}=0,\] <p>hence</p> \[\boxed{ 0=\left\langle{0^{+}}\right\rvert \phi'\left\lvert{0^{+}}\right\rangle, \quad \phi':= \mathcal{D}_ {v }^{\dagger}\phi \mathcal{D}_ {v }. }\] <p>It inspires us to define a new Hamiltonian exactly in the same fashion,</p> \[\boxed{ \mathcal{H} := \mathcal{D}_ {v }^{\dagger} \hat{\mathcal{H}} \mathcal{D}_ {v }=\hat{\mathcal{H}}(\mathcal{D}^{\dagger}\phi \mathcal{D}) = \hat{\mathcal{H}}(\phi'). }\] <p>We are interested in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian. The good news is that, a unitary transformation preserves all the observables! Thus, in order to study the quantum correction, instead of working with the triplet $\hat{H}$, $\phi$ and $\left\lvert{0^{+}}\right\rangle$ where perturbative method fails, we can work with $H, \phi’$ and $\left\lvert{0^{+}}\right\rangle$ where $\phi’$ can be dealt with perturbatively.</p> <p>Generally speaking, let $\mathcal{O}$ be any operator and $\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$ its eigenstate. If $\mathcal{O}’=\mathcal{D}^{\dagger}\mathcal{O} \mathcal{D}$ is the unitary transformation of $\mathcal{O}$, then its eigenstate is $\mathcal{D}^{\dagger}\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$, not $\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$. It may seem weird to some people to put $\mathcal{O}’$ together with $\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$ rather than $\mathcal{D}^{\dagger}\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$. In fact, it is exactly the point of our method! If we pair $\mathcal{O}’$ with $\mathcal{D}^{\dagger}\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$ it would be a trivial transformation, we will get nothing new! Paring up $\mathcal{O}’$ and $\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$ makes it possible for perturbation methods.</p> <p>However, since $\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$ is not the eigen state of $\mathcal{O}’$, it indeed raise some troubles, the first and foremost is that now $\mathcal{O}’$ is in general not diagonalized by $\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$, we need to find a way to diagonalized it. In our current case, since the displacement operator only shifts the operators by a constant, it actually preserves the diagonalization, meaning if $\hat{\mathcal{H}}$ is diagonalized in $\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$’s then $\mathcal{D}^{\dagger} \hat{\mathcal{H}}\mathcal{D}$ is also diagonalized in $\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$’s. But for a generic $\mathcal{D}_ {f}$ with non-trivial $f$, this will no longer be true. That would be the topic for the other half the the note, after we introduce the kink solution.</p> <p>A comparison between displacement operator method to the case of regular functions might be helpful.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Functions</th> <th style="text-align: center">perturbative QFT</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">A functions $f(x)$, a neighborhood about a special locus $x_ 0$ where the interesting things happen.</td> <td style="text-align: center">A Hilbert space, a quantum state $\left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle$ of interest represented by a functional $\left\langle \Psi(x),- \right\rangle$, and some operator $\mathcal{O}(\phi)$.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">We want to study the function $f(x )$ at $x_ 0$ perturbatively,</td> <td style="text-align: center">We want to study the $\left\langle{\Psi}\right\rvert\mathcal{O}\left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle$ perturbatively,</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">but $x_ 0$ too far from the origin, so Maclaurin expansion (Taylor expansion at the origin) fails.</td> <td style="text-align: center">but $\left\langle{\Psi}\right\rvert\phi \left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle=:f(x)$ is too large for $\phi$ to be treated perturbatively.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center"><strong>In a passive perspective, we shift the origin</strong> to $x_ 0$, then small deviation from $x_ 0$ can now be studied using Maclaurin expansion perturbatively.</td> <td style="text-align: center">In a passive perspective, we shift the operators, especially the field operator $\phi$ since it is usually the building block of other operators.

This property is crucial in solving partial differential equations, as it allows the expansion of functions in terms of these eigenfunctions (similar to Fourier series).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Boundary Conditions</strong>: Sturm-Liouville problems are typically accompanied by boundary conditions that the solutions must satisfy. These conditions are usually specified at the endpoints of the interval in which the equation is defined.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In our case, the weight function is trivial.</p> <p>We will denote the zero mode (eigenfunction with eigenvalue zero) by ${\mathfrak g}_ {B}$ and the shape mode (the next level up to zero mode) by ${\mathfrak g}_ {S}$. The $B$ in ${\mathfrak g}_ {B}$ has a historical reason (B stands for bounded state), but in our note it is just part of the name. These modes include a continuum</p> \[{\mathfrak g} _ {k}(x) = \frac{e^{-ikx}}{\omega_ {k} \sqrt{m^2+4k^2}}\left[2k^2-m^2+(3/2)m^2\text{sech}^2(m x/2)-3im k\tanh(m x/2)\right]\] <p>with eigenvalue $\omega_ {k} = \sqrt{ k^{2}+m^{2} }$, a zero mode</p> \[{\mathfrak g}_ {B} = -\sqrt{ \frac{3m}{8} } \text{sech}^{2}\left( \frac{mx}{2} \right)\] <p>with eigenvalue $0$, and a shape mode</p> \[{\mathfrak g} _ {S} = \frac{\sqrt{ 3m }}{2} \tanh \frac{mx}{2} \text{sech} \frac{mx}{2},\quad \omega_ {S} = \frac{\sqrt{ 3 }}{2}m\] <p>with eigenvalue less then the rest mass of excited particle.</p> <p>The normalization conditions are</p> \[\int dx \, {\mathfrak g}_ {S}^{2} = \int dx \, {\mathfrak g}_ {B}^{2} = 1 , \quad \int dx \, {\mathfrak g}_ {B}{\mathfrak g}_ {S} = 0 ,\quad \int dx \, {\mathfrak g}_ {k}(x){\mathfrak g}_ {p}(x) = 2\pi i\delta(p-k).\] <p>The completion condition reads</p> \[\sum\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\int \; \frac{dk}{2\pi} \, \mathfrak{g} _ {k} (x)\mathfrak{g} _ {k} ^\ast (y)=\delta(x-y).\] <p>and $\mathfrak{g}_ {k}^\ast(x)=\mathfrak{g}_ {-k}(x)$.</p> <p>The sign of ${\mathfrak g}_ {B}$ is fixed using</p> \[{\mathfrak g}_ {B}(x) = - \frac{f'(x)}{\sqrt{ Q_ {0} } },\] <p>where $f$ is again the kink solution.</p> <p>This can be generalized to more than one spatial dimension. Take two dimension for example, without loss of generality, we can choose to lie the kink in the $x$ direction.</p> <p>The important thing is that, the free kink Hamiltonian is diagonalized by normal mode. what I mean is that, if we expand the kink field in terms of normal modes:</p> \[\begin{align*} \varphi(x) &amp;= \sum\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\int \frac{ dk}{(2\pi )\sqrt{2\omega _ {k} } } \, \left( b_ {k} {\mathfrak g}_ {k} (x)+h.c. \right),\\ \pi(x) &amp;= \sum\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\int \frac{dk}{(2\pi ) } \frac{-i\sqrt{\omega_ {k}}}{\sqrt{2}}\, \left( b_ {k}\mathfrak{g}_ {k} (x) - b_ {k}^{\dagger}\mathfrak{g}_ {k} ^\ast (x) \right){\mathfrak g}_ {k} (x), \end{align*}\] <p>where</p> \[\sum\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\int \, dk := \sum_ {B,S}+\int \frac{dk}{2\pi}.\] <p>it can be verified that</p> \[[b_ {k} ,\mathcal{D}_ {f}] = \mathcal{D}_ {f} \frac{\mathfrak{f} _ {k}+\mathfrak{f} _ {-k}^\ast }{2},\] <p>where $\mathfrak{f}_ {k}$ is the coefficient in spanning $f(x)$ in terms of $\mathfrak{g}_ {k}(x)$:</p> \[f(x)=\sum\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\int \; \frac{dk}{2\pi} \, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega _ {k} }}(\mathfrak{f} _ {k} \mathfrak{g} _ {k} (x)+\text{c.c.}),\] <p>where c.c. stands for complex conjugation. From this commutation relation we can see that if $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle$ is a state annihilated by $b_ {k}$, then $\mathcal{D}_ {f}\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle$ is a coherent state regarding $b_ {k}$ since</p> \[b_ {k} \mathcal{D}_ {f}\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle = \mathcal{D}_ {f}\mathcal{D}_ {f}^{\dagger}b_ {k} \mathcal{D}_ {f} \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle= \mathcal{D}_ {f}(b_ {k} +(\cdots))\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle =(\cdots) \mathcal{D}_ {f}\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle,\] <p>where $(\cdots)=\frac{\mathfrak{f} _ {k}+\mathfrak{f} _ {-k}^\ast }{2}$ is a c-number.</p> <hr/> <p>in normal modes (in the kink background), while expanding in the $y$ direction in plane waves.

Ultimately, the difference across different sectors lies in the diverse backgrounds (regarded as classical functions) used for field expansion. However, as we are analyzing the same theory within the same space-time, the theory should be quantized only once, and, all sectors must consistently align with the same quantization process.</p> <h2 id="need-for-a-new-set-of-ladder-operators">Need for a new set of ladder operators</h2> <h2 id="squeeze">Squeeze!</h2> <h1 id="linearized-soliton-perturbation-method-lspt">Linearized soliton perturbation method (LSPT)</h1> <p>Here we summarize the linearized soliton perturbation theory associated with generic solitonic classic solutions $f_ {\text{sol}}$</p> <h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1> <h2 id="loop-expansion-semi-classical-expansion-and-coupling-expansion">Loop expansion, semi-classical expansion and coupling expansion</h2> <p>There are three different but expansions that we usually don’t extinguish:</p> <ul> <li>Loop expansion, the expansion parameter is the number of loop. The leading contributions are tree diagrams.</li> <li>Semi-classical expansion, the expansion parameter is the Plank constant $\hbar$. At leading order, $\hbar=0$, we are left with classical contributions.</li> <li>Coupling expansion, the expansion parameter is the coupling $g,\lambda, \cdots$.</li> </ul> <p>Set the speed of light $c=1$. The action functional $S[\phi]$ has the unit of $[\hbar]=ET$, where $E$ is the energy unit and $T$ the time. The textbook proof of the equivalence between <em>loop expansion</em> and <em>semi-classical expansion</em>, i.e. $\hbar$-expansion usually goes as follows. First write the partition function (with the source term) with $\hbar$:</p> \[Z[J(x)] = \int \mathcal{D}\phi \, \exp \left\lbrace \frac{i}{\hbar} \int d^{d}x \, (\mathcal{L}+ J \phi) \right\rbrace ,\] <p>where $J=J(x)$ is the source term. Note that the source term is on the same basis of $\mathcal{L}$. Splitting the Lagrangian into free and interacting part, we can rewrite the interaction using functional derivative and put it in the front of the free partition function:</p> \[Z[J] = \exp \left\lbrace \frac{i}{\hbar}\mathcal{L}_ {\text{int}}\left( \frac{1}{i} \frac{\delta}{\delta J} \right) \right\rbrace Z_ {0}[J],\] <p>where $\mathcal{L}_ {\text{int}}$ is the interacting Lagrangian and</p> \[Z_ {0}[J] = \int \mathcal{D}\phi \, \exp \left\lbrace \frac{i}{\hbar}\int d^{d}x\, (\mathcal{L}_ {0}+ J\phi) \right\rbrace\] <p>is the free partition function with the source. It can be integrated out in the closed form (for the level of rigorous for a physicist) to give</p> \[Z_ {0}[J] = N \exp \left\lbrace - \frac{i}{2}\hbar \int d^{d}x d^{d}y \, J(x) \Delta_ {F}(x-y)J(y) \right\rbrace,\] <p>where $\Delta_ {F}$ is the Feynman propagator. It shows that each propagator contributes a factor of $\hbar$.</p> <p>Next, since each diagrammatic vertex is a result of a functional derivative $\frac{i}{\hbar }\mathcal{L}_ {\text{int}}\left( \frac{\delta}{\delta J} \right)$, each vertex contributes a factor of $\frac{1}{\hbar}$. Then, using some relations between the numbers of loops, propagators and vertices (it depends on the specific model), <strong>amputate the external legs</strong>, it can be shown that: a general graph with $L$ loops is proportional to $\hbar^{L-1}$. Thus an expansion in the number of loops is also an expansion in powers of $\hbar$.</p> <hr/> <p>It turns out that there are more than one way to assign $\hbar$-dependence to parameters in the Lagrangian, such as mass $m$, the coupling $g,\lambda$, etc. A criterion for the “right” choice is that, at $\hbar\to 0$, the quantum theory agrees with the classical theory. As an example, Stanley Brodsky and Paul Hoyer in their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.2313.pdf">paper</a> used the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator as an example in Eq.(1). The gist is that you can rescale $x$ to $x / \sqrt{ \hbar }$, then the propagator is formally independent of $\hbar$. However, this will change how we view distance, in the $\hbar\to 0$ limit, for a fixed distance $L$, the “length” measure will increase as $1 / \sqrt{ \hbar }$, hence we are going to smaller and smaller area.</p> <p>It is generally understood that each loop contribution to amplitudes is associated with one factor of $\hbar$. However, to fully define the $\hbar\to 0$ limit one need to specify the $\hbar$ dependence of various quantities in the Lagrangian as mentioned before, such as the field operator, the mass, the coupling, etc. This is not as straightforward as one might think, for $\hbar$ not only appears in the action $iS / \hbar$ but also appears in the Lagrangian. In Brodsky’s paper mentioned above, the authors proposed a way to establish the $\hbar$ dependence such that the loop and $\hbar$ expansions are equivalent. We will go to more details in the following.</p> <p><strong>First, regard $\hbar$ as a constant of nature with certain dimension, use $\hbar$ to make terms in the Lagrangian dimensionless.</strong></p> <p>Again let’s work with the assumption that $c = \epsilon_ {0} = 1$. Require $[S]=\hbar$, and $\alpha_ {s} = g^{2} / 4\pi \hbar$ is dimensionless, the latter implies that $[g]=[\sqrt{ \hbar }]=\sqrt{ ET }=\sqrt{ EL }$. From the self-energy of gluons $G_ {\mu \nu}G^{\mu \nu}$ where $G = \partial A - \partial A +ig / \hbar [A,A]$ we have</p> \[[A] = \sqrt{ \frac{E}{L} }.\] <p>Similarly, in scalar QED model the classical electric charge $e$ and mass $m$ are divided by $\hbar$,</p> \[S_ {\text{sQED} } = \int d^{4}x \, \left\lbrace \left\lvert D\phi \right\rvert ^{2}-\frac{m^{2} }{\hbar^{2} }\left\lvert \phi \right\rvert ^{2} \right\rbrace , \quad D = \partial +i \frac{e}{\hbar }A.\] <p>The boson field dimension</p> \[[\phi]=[A]= \sqrt{ \frac{E}{L} }.\] <p>Fermion fields are more complicated, since they have no classical counterparts, their dimensions are convention-dependent. We will deal with fermions in a different note perhaps.</p> <p><strong>Second step is to specify $\hbar$ dependence of all quantities appearing in the action.</strong></p> <p>The choice made by Brodsky and Hoyer is as following. Define</p> \[\widetilde{A}:= \frac{A}{\sqrt{ \hbar } },\quad \tilde{\phi}:= \frac{\phi}{\sqrt{ \hbar } }\] <p>where $\widetilde{A},\tilde{\phi}$ are $\hbar$-independent. Similarly, define the following $\hbar$-independent quantities</p> \[\widetilde{g}:= \frac{g}{\hbar},\quad \widetilde{e}:= \frac{e}{\hbar},\quad \widetilde{m}:= \frac{m}{\hbar}.\] <p>Then one can write the Lagrangian in terms of these $\hbar$-independent quantities to check the $\hbar$ dependence explicitly. It turns out that, at least in the simple models discussion in the paper, $\hbar$ always appears in the combination</p> \[\widetilde{g}\sqrt{ \hbar } \quad \text{and}\quad \widetilde{e}\sqrt{ \hbar }\] <p>that is, with the coupling. Hence loop correction of $\mathcal{O}(g^{2},e^{2})$ will be of order $\hbar$.</p> <p>This derivation is equivalent to the standard textbook treatments, for example in Mark Srednicki’s textbook, which associates a factor $\hbar$ to each propagator and $h^{-1}$ with each vertex, and assume that the parameters appearing in the action are independent of $\hbar$.</p> <p>Fore more details refer to Brodsky and Hoyer’s paper mentioned above. The takeaway is that, the correspondence between loop expansion and $\hbar$ expansion is widely accepted, taken for granted, but convention dependent.</p> <p>The semi-classical approximation is also a result of small fluctuation about certain classical background.

The gist is that the integral can be approximated by an asymptotic power expansion, the leading term is given by its stationary value:</p> \[\int_ {-\infty}^{\infty} dx \, e^{ -S(x) / \hbar } f(x) \sim e^{ -S(x_ {0}) / \hbar }f(x_ {0}) \frac{\sqrt{2\pi \hbar}}{\sqrt{\partial^{2}S{\Large\mid}_ {x_ {0}} }} \, A(\hbar)\] <p>where $x_ {0}$ is the stationary point and $A(\hbar)$ is an asymptotic power series in $\hbar$,</p> \[A(\hbar) = 1+A_ {1} \hbar + A_ {2} \hbar^{2} + \cdots\] <p>which, being an asymptotic series, eventually diverges.

A blog explicitly devoted to Yoneda lemma which is sometime useful in dealing with gauge theory can be found <a href="https://www.mathlimbo.net/blog/2024/Yoneda-Lemma/">here</a>, but I doubt we will need it in this note.</p> <hr/> <p>Quantum mechanics is defined over the spatial coordinates $\vec{x}$. The position eigenstates $\left\lvert{\vec{x}}\right\rangle$ form a complete basis of the Hilbert space. However, $\left\lvert{\vec{x}}\right\rangle$ is represented by a Dirac $\delta$-function, which does not belong to the Hilbert space of $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$, where $d$ is the dimension of the space, as usually. It is a challenge to mathematical rigor of quantum mechanics.</p> <p>Recall that the Hilbert space $L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ consists of all square-integrable functions defined on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, with an inner product $\left\langle f,g \right\rangle=\int dx \, f^{\ast}g$. This inner product also defines a norm, and with norm we can talk about Cauchy completeness. The space $L^{2}$ is indeed Cauchy complete, since we do not require functions in it to be smooth. The Cauchy completeness makes it a Hilbert space, not a pre-Hilbert space.</p> <p>To deal with mathematical objects such as the Dirac $\delta$-function, quantum mechanics often uses the concept of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rigged Hilbert space</code>, also known as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gelfand triplet</code>. A rigged Hilbert space involves three components:</p> <ol> <li>Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}$, the space of <strong>rapidly decreasing smooth</strong> functions. It is a dense subspace of the Hilbert space that we talk about in the next paragraph. By working with $\mathcal{S}$, we can rigorously define unbounded operators and their domains. States here are smooth and decays faster than any polynomial, making them suitable for rigorous operator definitions.</li> <li>Hilbert space $L^{2}$. The Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}$ is a dense subset of $L^{2}$. Here is where all the quantum states reside. These states are normalizable and have finite norm.</li> <li>Dual space $\mathcal{S}^{\ast}$. It includes functionals, also called generalized states. The Dirac delta function represents the position eigenstate, while plane waves represent momentum eigenstates, we can’t fit them into the Hilbert space $L^{2}$, here is where these pathological states reside.</li> </ol> <p>The relationship can be written as</p> \[\mathcal{S} \subset L^{2} \subset \mathcal{S}^{\ast }.\] <p>Actually, I don’t think it makes a lot of sense to regard $\left\lvert{\vec{x}}\right\rangle$ as a physical state, since in real life, due to the uncertainty principal, a particle will never be localized at a specific point. Instead, the position always smears about a certain region, so is its momentum. The role of $\left\lvert{\vec{x}}\right\rangle$ is more of giving us the value of the wave function at position $\vec{x}$, in other words, what naturally appears is the dual version $\left\langle{\vec{x}}\right\rvert$ of $\left\lvert{\vec{x}}\right\rangle$. $\left\langle{\vec{x}}\right\rvert$ can be regarded as map that takes a state in the Hilbert space of quantum states, and spits out a complex number:</p> \[\begin{align*} \left\langle{\vec{x}}\right\rvert : \quad \mathcal{H} &amp;\to \mathbb{C} \\ \left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle &amp;\mapsto \psi(\vec{x}), \end{align*}\] <p>where $\mathcal{H}$ is not the Hamiltonian but the Hilbert space of quantum states.</p> <p>For a state $\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$ to be a physical state, it should be sensible to talk about</p> \[\left\langle{\psi}\right\rvert \mathcal{O} \left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle ,\quad \mathcal{O}\text{ is an observable.}\] <p>$\left\lvert{\vec{x}}\right\rangle$ fails this requirement since $\left\langle{\vec{x}}\right\rvert \hat{x} \left\lvert{\vec{x}}\right\rangle=\infty$, this is another reason to say that $\left\lvert{\vec{x}}\right\rangle$ is not a physical state.</p> <hr/> <p>We distinguish two concepts, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">states</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wave function</code>. In quantum mechanics, they are sometimes used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings. A quantum state contains all the information about the system. It can be described in different representations, depending on what information we want to know. For example, if we want to know information about the position, we go to the physical space representation expanded by $\left\lvert{\vec{x}}\right\rangle$. Quantum states can be represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and there exists pure and mixed states. On the other hand, the wave function is a specific representation of a quantum state in the position (or sometimes momentum) basis. It is a complex-valued function that gives the probability amplitude of finding a particle in a particular position in space. The wave function of a state $\left\lvert{\psi}\right\rangle$ is denoted by $\psi(x)$, where $x$ is the position.</p> <p>In the passive perspective, a state before and after spatial translation is the same state, they just have different wave functions, because in order to get the wave function we need two things: bases and a state, even though the state is unchanged but the bases are changed now, thus the final expression is also changed.</p> <p>Consider a scalar field theory. All the possible configuration of $\phi$ form the configuration space $\mathcal{C}$, each point represents a specific field function $(\mathcal{M}\times\mathbb{R})\to \mathbb{C}$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is the space manifold and $\mathbb{R}$ the time dimension. The wave functional $\Psi[f(x)]$ describes the quantum state at a given time, we have</p> \[\Psi: \mathcal{C} \to \mathbb{C}, \quad f (\vec{x}) \mapsto \Psi[f].\] <p>Similar to quantum mechanics where $\left\lvert{\vec{x}}\right\rangle$ is the eigen state of $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{x}\left\lvert{\vec{x}}\right\rangle=\vec{x}$, in QFT the eigen state of field operator $\hat{\phi}$ satisfy</p> \[\hat{\phi}(\vec{x})\left\lvert{\phi}\right\rangle = \phi(\vec{x})\left\lvert{\phi}\right\rangle ,\] <p>Any wave functional can be given as a superposition of such eigen states. Let $\left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle$ be a well-behaved wave functions, it can be formally written as</p> \[\left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle = \int D\phi(\vec{x}) \, \Psi[\phi(\vec{x})] \left\lvert{\phi(\vec{x})}\right\rangle ,\] <p>We will simply write $\phi$ and omit the spatial coordinate.</p> <p>Given the quantum state $\left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle$, the amplitude of a certain configuration $\phi$ is</p> \[\Psi [\phi(\bullet)] = \left\langle \phi \middle\vert \Psi \right\rangle \in \mathbb{C}.\] <p>As a consistency check, let’s see if we can reproduce the result $\left\langle{\Psi}\right\rvert\hat{\phi}(\vec{x}) \left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle=\psi(\vec{x})$ for some classical field $\psi(\vec{x})$. We have</p> \[\begin{align*} \left\langle{\Psi}\right\rvert \hat{\phi}(\vec{x})\left\lvert{\Psi}\right\rangle &amp;= \int D\varphi \, \Psi ^\ast [\varphi]\left\langle{\varphi}\right\rvert\, \hat{\phi}(\vec{x})\,\int D\varphi' \, \Psi[\varphi']\left\lvert{\varphi'}\right\rangle \\ &amp;= \int D\varphi \, \Psi^\ast [\varphi] D\varphi' \, \Psi[\varphi']\left\langle{\varphi}\right\rvert\, \varphi'(\vec{x})\left\lvert{\varphi'}\right\rangle \\ &amp;= \int D\varphi \, \Psi^\ast [\varphi] D\varphi' \, \Psi[\varphi'] \varphi'(\vec{x}) \delta(\varphi-\varphi') \\ &amp;= \int D\varphi \, \Psi^\ast [\varphi]\, \Psi[\varphi] \varphi(\vec{x}) \\ &amp;= \int D\varphi \, \left\lvert \Psi[\varphi] \right\rvert^{2} \varphi(\vec{x}), \end{align*}\] <p>and recall that $\left\lvert \Psi[\varphi] \right\rvert^{2}$ is the probability of finding $\varphi$ in $\Psi$, thus indeed we have</p> \[\int D\varphi \, \left\lvert \Psi[\varphi] \right\rvert^{2} \varphi(\vec{x}) = \left\langle \hat{\phi}(\vec{x}) \right\rangle =: \psi(\vec{x}).\] <p>Time evolution is generated by the Hamiltonian, yielding a functional Schrodinger equation:</p> \[i\hbar \left\lvert{\Psi[\phi]}\right\rangle = \hat{H}\left\lvert{\Psi[\phi]}\right\rangle ,\] <hr/> <p>For the ground state (or vacuum state) of the free scalar field, the wave functional $\Psi_0[\phi]$ has a Gaussian form, it is basically an infinite lattice of harmonic oscillators.

Whenever the <strong>non-abelian</strong> gauge group is broken to its <strong>Cartan subgroup</strong> (Cartan subalgebra is spanned by a maximal mutual-commuting basis of Lie algebra) by adjoint Higgs bosons, we have magnetic monopoles. The <strong>adjoint</strong> Higgs fields have non-zero vacuum expectation values (VEV for short, denoted by $\left\langle \bullet \right\rangle$), breaking the gauge symmetry. Those gauge transformations that leave $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle$ invariant are symmetries not broken by the Higgs bosons.</p> <p>Loosely speaking there are two kinds of symmetries:</p> <ul> <li>the symmetry of the Lagrangian,</li> <li>the symmetry of the vacuum.</li> </ul> <p>What about gauge symmetry? Gauge symmetry is not really a symmetry, rather it is a redundancy, corresponds to the freedom of a change of basis.</p> <p>Sometimes, a symmetry is preserved in the Lagrangian but not the vacuum, meaning that the symmetry will change the vacuum, e.g. the double well potential in quantum mechanics, the $x \leftrightarrow -x$ transformation doesn’t change the Lagrangian, but it turns one vacuum to the other, thus it is not a symmetry of the vacuum. In this case we say this symmetry is spontaneously broken. Of course, since the spontaneously broken symmetry is still a symmetry of the Hamiltonian, it preserves the energy and only takes one vacuum (minimal energy) to another. In more mathematical terms, let $H$ be the broken symmetry and $\phi_ {0}$ be any vacuum configuration, the orbit of $H$ acting on $\phi_ {0}$ is the vacuum manifold, or at least a connected submanifold of vacuum.</p> <p>Why should we start with $SU(2)$ monopole? because</p> <ul> <li>it is the simplest monopole in Yang-Mills theory, and</li> <li>$SU(2)$ monopole solution is the building block for monopole solutions in larger groups.</li> </ul> <p>In $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory, the generator is $T^a = \frac{1}{2}\sigma^a$, where $\sigma$’s are the Pauli matrices, with inner product defined by the trace:</p> \[\left\langle T^{a} \middle\vert T^b \right\rangle := \text{Tr }{T^a T^b} = \frac{1}{2}\delta^{ab}\] <p>Besides the gauge field, let us add the triplet Higgs scalar in the adjoint representation,</p> \[\phi = \frac{\sigma^a}{2}\phi^a\] <p>with convention $\left\lvert \phi \right\rvert^{2} := \phi^a \phi^a = 2\text{Tr }(\phi^2)$. In our convention, if $\phi$ without absolute value notation is squared, we are simply squaring the matrix field itself, while if $\left\lvert \phi \right\rvert$ is squared, we are doing the module square.</p> <p>The action is</p> \[S = \int d^4 x \, \left\lbrace {-\frac{1}{2e^2}\text{Tr }F_ {\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+ \frac{1}{e^2}\mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lvert D_ \mu \phi \right\rvert ^2-V(\phi)}\right\rbrace,\] <p>where</p> \[V(\phi) = - \mu^2 \text{Tr }{\phi^2} + \lambda(\text{Tr }{\phi^2})^2 = -\frac{\mu^2}{2}\phi^a \phi^a +\frac{\lambda}{4}(\phi^a \phi^a )^2,\] <p>the vacuum manifold is $\mathbb{S}^{2}$. To see this we can complete the square</p> \[V = \frac{\lambda}{4} \left( \phi^a\phi^a-v^2 \right)^2-\frac{\mu^4}{4\lambda}, \quad v^2 = \frac{\mu^2}{\lambda},\] <p>If $v^{2}&lt;0$, the model is in confined phase. We will assume that $v^{2}&gt;0$, so the theory sits in the Higgs phase. One possible vacuum is obtained at</p> \[\left\langle \phi^{1} \right\rangle = \left\langle \phi^2 \right\rangle = 0,\, \left\langle \phi^3 \right\rangle = v,\, \left\langle A \right\rangle = 0.\] <p>The VEV of $\vec{\phi}$ field points to the $z$-direction. Now the gauge symmetry $SU(2)$ is broken to $U(1)$, since the vacuum for the Higgs is $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle=\phi^{3}T^{3}$ and only the gauge transformation given by $e^{i\theta^3 T^3}$ preserves the vacuum:</p> \[SU(2) \to U(1).\] <p>It is often useful to borrow the terminologies from QED, separating the field strength into “magnetic” and “electric” part,</p> \[\begin{align*} B_ i &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \epsilon_ {ijk}F_ {jk},\\ E_ i &amp;= F_ {0i}. \end{align*}\] <p>Note that in Yang-Mills theory, $B$ and $E$ are matrices and they are not gauge invariant, in contrast to $U(1)$ theory. It means that $B,E$ are no longer physical observables (which must be gauge invariant), such as the trace of $F_ {\mu\nu}^2$ or the Wilson loops.</p> <p>Since we have chosen the vacuum to be $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle = v T^3$, in the unitary gauge, the degrees of freedom are</p> <ul> <li>two massive gauge bosons, $W_ \mu^\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(A_ \mu^1 \pm i A_ \mu^2)$. The mass comes solely from the covariant derivative $\left\lvert D_ \mu \phi \right\rvert^2$, after shifting $\phi^3$ to $\phi^3 + v$, the coupling between A and $\phi^3$ is</li> </ul> \[\frac{1}{2}\frac{v^2}{e^2}A_ \mu^a A^{a\mu}\equiv \frac{1}{2}m_ W^2 A^2,\quad a = 1,2\] <ul> <li>$A^3$ remains massless, it is the “photon” decoupled from $\phi^3$</li> <li>$\phi^3$ particle is electrically neutral.</li> </ul> <p>For the total energy to be finite, it must be that at spatial infinity, the field configuration goes to a vacuum configuration fast enough:</p> \[\left\lvert \phi \right\rvert \to v,\quad \left\lvert D_ \mu \phi \right\rvert ^2 \to 0, \quad A \to i \Omega \partial_ \mu\Omega^{-1}.\] <p>Note that $\left\lvert D_ \mu \phi \right\rvert^2$ must drop to zero faster than $r^{-3/2}$ to make the total energy finite.</p> <p>The topology of the space boundary is $\mathbb{S}^2$ since $\partial \mathbb{R}^3 = \mathbb{S}^2$. The vacuum manifold of the Higgs field is also $\mathbb{S}^2$, thus the Higgs field at $r \to \infty$ is a map $\mathbb{S}^2 \to \mathbb{S}^2$, which is classified by homotopy group $\pi_ 2(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}$, where $\mathbb{Z}$ is the addition group of integers. We can use homotopy to classify topologically different solutions, labeling any finite energy Higgs configuration by an integer $n$, which counts the winding number of Higgs field at infinity. Given a $\phi$ field configuration, Let $\hat{\phi}^{i} \equiv \phi^{i} / \left\lvert \phi \right\rvert$ be the unit field vector, the winding number is give by integrating the <em>pullback</em> of the volume in $\phi$ configuration space:</p> \[\boxed{ n = \frac{1}{8\pi}\epsilon_ {ijk} \epsilon_ {abc} \int d^2S_ i \, \hat{\phi}^{a}\partial_ {j} \hat{\phi}^{b}\partial_ {k} \hat{\phi}^{c} }\] <p>The trivial vacuum where $\phi = \text{const}$ everywhere obviously has $n = 0$.</p> <p>Consider the case where the winding number $n=1$. $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle$ at infinity depends on the direction. The residual U(1) symmetry of $SU(2)$ consists of the elements that commutes with $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle$, thus the unbroken $U(1)$ direction also depends on the position. Recall that $A_ \mu = A_ \mu^a T^a$ as a $\mathfrak{su}(2)$-valued field, the components of $A_ {\mu}$ that commutes with $\phi$ can be projected out (in any direction) via</p> \[a_ \mu = \frac{2}{v} \text{Tr }{\phi A_ \mu},\] <p>for example, if $\phi = v T^3, \, a_ \mu = A_ \mu^3$.</p> <p>The unbroken U(1) component can be regarded as a vector in the Lie-algebra whose direction, after choosing a vacuum $\phi_ {0}$, is parallel to $\phi_ {0}$. For example, if $\phi_ {0}$ is chosen to be $vT^3$, then the unbroken U(1) group is proportional to $T^3$. Again, in the case of a monopole solution, the U(1) direction is position-dependent.</p> <p>Let’s look at the covariant derivative. In order to make sure that $\left\lvert D_ \mu\phi \right\rvert^{2} = \left\lvert \partial_ \mu\phi-i[A_ \mu,\phi] \right\rvert^{2} \to 0$, we need to find a corresponding $A_ \mu$ that can cancel the $\partial_ \mu \phi$, for $\phi = v \hat{\phi}$.</p> <p>The following identities might be helpful:</p> \[\phi^2 = \phi^a T^a \phi^b T^b = \frac{1}{2}\phi^a\phi^b \left\lbrace T^a ,T^b \right\rbrace= \boxed{ \frac{v^2}{4}=\phi^{2}}.\] <p>For Pauli matrices we have</p> \[\sigma^i \sigma^j = \delta^{ij} + i \epsilon^{ijk}\sigma^k.\] <p>If $\phi^{2}$ is constant, we have</p> \[\partial_ \mu \phi^2 = 0 = \left\lbrace \partial_ \mu \phi,\phi \right\rbrace\] <p>thus</p> \[[\partial_ \mu \phi,\phi] = -2\phi\partial_ \mu \phi\] <p>and</p> \[\left[ [\partial_ \mu \phi,\phi],\phi \right] = v^2 \partial_ \mu \phi.\] <p>Let</p> \[\boxed{ A_ \mu = -\frac{i}{v^2} [\partial_ \mu \phi,\phi]+\frac{a_ \mu}{v}\phi, }\] <p>then</p> \[-i [A_ \mu,\phi] = - \partial_ \mu \phi,\] <p>$a_ \mu$ above is the same as the unbroken U(1) field. We see that $A_ {\mu}$ is the asymptotic gauge field.</p> <p>Knowing the asymptotic form of the gauge field, we can work out the asymptotic form of $F_ {\mu\nu}$, however we are mostly interested in the U(1) part, that is the field strength in the same direction of $\phi$,</p> \[\begin{align} \notag F_ {\mu\nu} &amp;= \partial_ \mu A_ \nu-\partial_ \nu A_ \mu-i[{A_ \mu},{A_ \nu}]\\ &amp;= \frac{\phi}{v}(\partial_ \mu a_ \nu - \partial_ \nu a_ \mu )+\frac{i}{v^2}[{\partial_ \mu \phi},{\partial_ \nu \phi}] + \frac{a_ \mu }{v} \partial_ \nu \phi - \frac{a_ \nu }{v} \partial_ \mu \phi \end{align}\] <p>The last two terms are orthogonal to $\phi$ thus we can discard them. Writing</p> \[F_ {\mu\nu} = \cdots + f_ {\mu\nu}\frac{\phi}{v}\] <p>where</p> \[f_ {\mu\nu} = \partial_ \mu a_ \nu - \partial_ \mu a_ \nu +\frac{2i}{v^3}\text{Tr }{\phi[{\partial_ \mu \phi},{\partial_ \nu \phi}]}\] <p>is the U(1) field strength. The corresponding magnetic field is</p> \[B_ i = -\frac{1}{2} \epsilon_ {ijk}f_ {jk} = \cdots + \frac{1}{2v^3}\epsilon_ {ijk}\epsilon_ {abc}\phi^a \partial_ j \phi^{b}\partial_ {k} \phi^{c}\] <p>The last term is a surprise since it comes from the non-abelian part, whose contribution to the magnetic charge is proportional to the topological charge</p> \[m = \int d^2S_ i\, B_ i = \frac{1}{2} \int d^2S_ i\, \epsilon_ {ijk}\epsilon_ {abc}\hat{\phi}^a \partial_ j \hat{\phi}^{b}\partial_ {k} \hat{\phi}^{c} = 4\pi n\] <p>where n is the winding number. The $\partial_ \mu a_ \nu - \partial_ \mu a_ \nu$ term doesn’t contribution to the magnetic charge since its contribution to the magnetic field is a curl, whose divergence vanishes. Such solution with a quantized U(1) magnetic charge goes by the name ‘t Hooft-Polyakov monopole.</p> <hr/> <p>Above we have given a general analyses, to find the explicit monopole solution, we introduce the hedgehog ansatz for winding number $n = 1$, a natural guess for the solution for $\phi$:</p> \[\phi^i = v \hat{x}^i h(r), \quad h(r) \to \begin{cases} 1 &amp; r \to \infty \\ 0 &amp; r \to 0 \end{cases}.\] <p>We can find corresponding $A_ \mu$ at spatial infinity by solving</p> \[D_ i \phi = 0 \implies \partial_ i \hat{x}^a + \epsilon_ {abd}A_ \mu^b \hat{x}^c = 0\] <p>by multiplying both sides by $x_ j \epsilon_ {adj}$.

Here we use the Gothic font to denote the Lie algebra. Consequently,</p> <ul> <li>we have N-1 different kinds of electric charges, field may have various linear combination of these charges.</li> <li>There will be monopole solutions with respect to $U(1)^{N-1}$</li> </ul> <p>There are already some pretty nice references on SU(3) monopole, for example this one: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.14.2016.</p> <h1 id="abelian-projection-of-sun-qcd">Abelian Projection of SU(N) QCD</h1> <p>In studying nonperturbative effects like quark confinement in SU(N) QCD, it is often useful to extract an effective Abelian theory from QCD, which retains essential physics while simplifying computations. This approach is called the Abelian projection.</p> <p>Abelian projection is a method that extracts an Abelian $U(1)^{N-1}$ theory (for gauge group $SU(N)$) from a non-Abelian gauge theory like QCD by <em>partially fixing the gauge</em> so that only the Cartan subgroup (the maximal torus group) remains unbroken.</p> <p>There is strong evidence that confinement may be related to the concept of dual superconductivity, where the QCD vacuum behaves like a type-II superconductor with condensation of magnetic monopoles. In electrodynamics, magnetic charges and electric charges are treated symmetrically in Maxwell’s equations. In QCD, however:</p> <ul> <li>The electric sector corresponds to the color charges carried by quarks.</li> <li>The magnetic sector involves topological objects like monopoles that arise from the non-Abelian nature of the gauge group.</li> </ul> <p>The idea behind the Abelian projection is that even though QCD is a non-Abelian theory, its <strong>long-distance behavior</strong> might be dominated by Abelian degrees of freedom, similar to how superconductors exhibit Abelian gauge behavior.</p> <p>The Abelian projection involves fixing the gauge partially, such that only the maximal Abelian subgroup (Cartan subgroup) remains unbroken. Take $SU(3)$ QCD for example. The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ consists of eight generators $T^a (a=1,…,8)$, corresponding to eight gluon fields $A_ \mu^a$. Its Cartan subgroup consists of diagonal elements that form a maximal Abelian subgroup:</p> \[U(1)^{N-1} \subset SU(N).\] <p>For SU(3), the maximal Abelian subgroup is $U(1) \times U(1)$, generated by the two diagonal Gell-Mann matrices $T^3$ and $T^8$.</p> <hr/> <p>Gauge fixing means choosing a specific gauge transformation to simplify the theory while preserving essential physics. In Abelian projection, we choose a gauge-fixing condition that preserves only the Cartan subgroup.</p> <p>A common choice is to diagonalize a field like the Polyakov loop $P(x)$ or the adjoint Higgs field in the fundamental representation:</p> \[P(x) = \mathcal{P} \exp \left( i \int_ 0^\beta A_ 0(x, t) dt \right),\] <p>where $A_0$ is the time component of the gauge field and $\mathcal{P}$ denotes path ordering. By fixing a gauge such that $P(x)$ is diagonal, the remaining gauge freedom consists only of transformations in the Cartan subgroup (because $T^{3}$ and $T^{8}$ are also diagonal), effectively reducing the theory to an Abelian gauge theory.</p> <hr/> <p>After Abelian projection,</p> <ol> <li> <p>The gauge fields decompose into <strong>diagonal (Abelian) components</strong> and <strong>off-diagonal (charged) components</strong>:</p> \[A_ \mu = A_ \mu^{\text{diag}} + A_ \mu^{\text{off-diag}}.\] <p>The diagonal fields behave like photons in electromagnetism, while the off-diagonal fields carry color charge.</p> </li> <li> <p>Magnetic Monopoles Appear Naturally: The gauge fixing makes topological excitations like magnetic monopoles manifest.</p> </li> <li> <p>Supports the Dual Superconductor Picture: In a superconductor, electric charges form Cooper pairs that condense, leading to the <strong>Meissner effect</strong> (expulsion of magnetic fields). In QCD, the dual of this process suggests that <strong>monopoles condense</strong>, leading to the confinement of quarks via the dual Meissner effect.</p> </li> </ol> <h1 id="abelian-decomposition-in-su2">Abelian Decomposition in SU(2)</h1> <h2 id="decomposition-into-mathcalamathcalc-and-x">Decomposition into $\mathcal{A},\mathcal{C}$ and $X$</h2> <p>The Cho-Duan-Ge decomposition is a covariant separation of the gauge field into abelian and non-abelian components. Roughly speaking, the gauge potential is separated into</p> <ul> <li>abelian, restricted gauge potential. It is further separated into <ul> <li>topologically trivial part, or Maxwell part, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">neurons</code>. And</li> <li>topological part, or Dirac part. Similar to the monopole scalar solution.</li> </ul> </li> <li>valance gauge field which describes colored gluons, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chromons</code>.</li> </ul> <p>For the sake of simplicity we will begin with $SU(2)$. Take The $\mathfrak{g}$-valued gauge potential, let’s decompose it to the abelian sub-algebra, namely the Cartan subalgebra, and the rest of the gauge field that is orthogonal to the Cartan component. Introduce a <strong>right-handed orthonormal frame</strong> $(\hat{n}^{1},\hat{n}^{2},\hat{n}^{3})$ with $\hat{n}^{i}\hat{n}^{i}=1$. Choose the third component to be the so-called abelian direction, denoted it by $\hat{n}:=\hat{n}^{3}$. This notation is a bit confusing, but it was used in the original papers.</p> <p>Next, let’s put the vectors into Lie algebra space $\mathfrak{g}$, by assigning to each component $\hat{n}^{i}$ a basis $T^{a}\in\mathfrak{g}$, $T^{a} = \frac{\sigma^{a}}{2}$ for $SU(2)$. In order to follow the convention that fraktur letters denote $\mathfrak{g}$-valued stuff, let’s write $\mathfrak{n}$ for the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued unit vector $\hat{n}$, i.e. $\mathfrak{n}:= \hat{n}^{i}T^{i}$. Now we can treat $\mathfrak{n}$ as a static adjoint field, and act the covariant derivative on $\mathfrak{n}$, just as how we act covariant derivative on $\mathfrak{g}$-valued scalar fields. Furthermore, similar to what we did at the presence of a monopole, we can decompose the gauge field into two parts, that satisfies $D_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}=0$ and that does not. With the help of the following matrix identities:</p> \[\mathfrak{n}^{2}=\mathfrak{n}\cdot \mathfrak{n}=\hat{n}^{a}\hat{n}^{b}T^{a}T^{b}=\frac{1}{4}\mathbb{1}_ {2},\quad T:=\frac{1}{2}\sigma\] <p>and consequently</p> \[\partial \mathfrak{n}^{2}=0=(\partial \mathfrak{n})\mathfrak{n}+\mathfrak{n}\partial \mathfrak{n}\implies \partial \mathfrak{n} \mathfrak{n} = -\mathfrak{n}\partial \mathfrak{n},\] <p>we can solve the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued equation $D_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}=0$ for $A_ {\mu}$, like we did for the $SU(2)$ monopole in the previous chapter. Expand the covariant derivative,</p> \[D_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} = (\partial_ {\mu}-ig[A,-])\mathfrak{n} = \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}-ig[A_ {\mu},\mathfrak{n}]=0,\] <p>the solution comprises of the abelian part that is proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$, and the non-abelian part that is perpendicular to $\mathfrak{n}$. We have the identity</p> \[[[\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n},\mathfrak{n}],\mathfrak{n}] = \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n},\] <p>thus the non-trivial part of the solution for $A_ {\mu}$, call it $\mathcal{C}_ {\mu}$, reads</p> \[\boxed{ \mathcal{C}_ {\mu} = \frac{i}{g} [\mathfrak{n},\partial_ {\mu} \mathfrak{n}] . }\] <p>This is a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued quantity, in basis $T^{a}$ it can be written as a cross product between 3-vectors,</p> \[\boxed{ \mathcal{C}_ {\mu} = - \frac{1}{g} \hat{n} \times (\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}) \text{ in }\mathfrak{g} . }\] <p>Given a solution for $A$, we can add to it any thing proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$ and it still is a solution, since the commutator gives the same result, hence the solutions contains a trivial part that is proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$, call it $\mathcal{A}$:</p> \[\boxed{ \mathcal{A}_ {\mu} = a_ {\mu} \mathfrak{n},\quad a_ {\mu}\in \mathbb{R}. }\] <p>Put together, the total solution $\hat{A}$ is called the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">restricted gauge field</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">restricted gauge potential</code>,</p> \[\hat{A}=\mathcal{A}+\mathcal{C}, \quad \mathcal{A} = a \mathfrak{n}\text{ and }\mathcal{C}=\frac{i}{g}[\mathfrak{n},\partial \mathfrak{n}],\] <p>where we have omitted the spacetime index $\mu$, it can be put back whenever needed.</p> <p>If the symmetry is broken to the subgroup $N$ induced by $\mathfrak{n}$, then $\mathcal{A}$ corresponds to the massless $U(1)$ component that can propagate for long distance. Geometrically, $\hat{A}$ is the component of the connection that leaves $\mathfrak{n}$ invariant during parallel transport.</p> <p>One way to remember that $\mathcal{C}$ comes with a factor of $1/g$ is that, it resembles the topological soliton solution such as the monopole, which always comes with a factor of $1/g$.</p> <hr/> <p>Next we carry on to study the field strength $\hat{F}$ corresponding to the restricted field $\hat{A}$. We can see that $\hat{F}$ is proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$, since from $D_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}=0$ we have</p> \[[\hat{D}_ {\mu},\hat{D}_ {\nu}]\mathfrak{n} =-\frac{i}{g}[\hat{F}_ {\mu \nu},\mathfrak{n} ]=0,\] <p>where $\hat{D}_ {\mu}$ is the covariant derivative with respect to $\hat{A}$, $\hat{D}=\partial-ig[\hat{A},-]$. This means that $\hat{F}$ must be proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$.</p> <p>The following identities are helpful (hold for $SU(2)$):</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathfrak{n} \mathfrak{n} = \hat{n}^{a}\hat{n}^{b}\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{a} \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{b} &amp;= \frac{1}{4}\mathbb{1}_ {2}, \\ [\mathfrak{n} ,[\mathfrak{n} ,\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} ]] &amp;= \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}, \\ [[\mathfrak{n},\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} ],[\mathfrak{n} ,\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} ]] &amp;= - \partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} . \end{align*}\] <p>We have</p> \[\begin{align*} \hat{F}:= &amp; \partial_ {\mu}\hat{A}_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}\hat{A}_ {\mu}-ig[\hat{A}_ {\mu},\hat{A}_ {\nu}]\\ =&amp; (\partial_ {\mu}a_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}a_ {\mu})\mathfrak{n} + \frac{i}{g}[\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} ,\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} ]\\ =&amp;: f_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} +H_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} . \end{align*}\] <p>It is not obvious that $[\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n},\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n}]$ is proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$. But after some derivation we find</p> \[[\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n},\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n}] = -(\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n})^{a}(\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n})^{b}\epsilon^{abc}T^{c},\] <p>which in $\mathfrak{g}$ is just $-(\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n})\times(\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n})$. Since $\partial \hat{n}$ is orthogonal to $\hat{n}$, their cross product is aligned with $\hat{n}$. So indeed $\hat{F}$ is aligned with $\mathfrak{n}$.</p> <p>$H_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n}$ is in matrix form, if we want to “project out” the components $H_ {\mu \nu}$, we can write</p> \[H_ {\mu \nu} \mathfrak{n} =\frac{1}{g} \partial_ {\mu} (i\mathfrak{n} \partial_ {\nu} \mathfrak{n}) -(\mu \leftrightarrow \nu),\] <p>This form is similar to $F_ {\mu \nu}=\partial_ {\mu}A_ {\mu}-(\mu\leftrightarrow \nu)$. In fact, in the case of $SU(2)$, we can simplify it further to give an explicit expression for $H_ {\mu \nu}$ (without $\mathfrak{n}$). The final expression will be in terms of $\hat{n}_ {1,2}$. Recall that $\hat{n}_ {1}, \hat{n}_ {2}, \hat{n}$ form a right-handed orthogonal basis, let $\mathfrak{n}_ {1,2}$ be the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued counterparts of $\hat{n}_ {1,2}$. It is easily verified that</p> \[[\mathfrak{n}_ {i},\mathfrak{n} _ {j}] = i\epsilon^{ijk}\mathfrak{n}_ {k} .\] <p>Since $\partial \hat{n}$ is perpendicular to $\hat{n}$ (since $\hat{n}$ has fixed length), $\partial \hat{n}=(\cdots)\hat{n}_ {1}+(\cdots)\hat{n}_ {2}$. In $\mathfrak{g}$-space we have the same. Write</p> \[\begin{align*} \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} =&amp; k_ {1}\mathfrak{n} _ {1}+k_ {2}\mathfrak{n} _ {2}, \\ \partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} =&amp; k'_ {1}\mathfrak{n} _ {1}+k'_ {2}\mathfrak{n} _ {2}, \end{align*}\] <p>then</p> \[H_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} = (k_ {2}k_ {1}'-k_ {1}k_ {2}')\mathfrak{n},\] <p>where $k_ {1}k_ {2}’$ is actually the $\mu \longleftrightarrow\nu$ replaced $k_ {2}k_ {1}’$. What are the $k$’s? Well, we can project them from $\partial \mathfrak{n}$, giving</p> \[\begin{align*} k_ {1} =&amp; \hat{n}_ {1} \cdot (\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}) = \hat{n}_ {1}\cdot\partial_ {\mu}(\hat{n}_ {1}\times \hat{n}_ {2}) = \hat{n}_ {1}\cdot (\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {1}\times \hat{n}_ {2}), \\ k_ {2} =&amp; \hat{n}_ {2}\cdot(\partial_ {\mu} \hat{n}) = \hat{n}_ {2}\cdot \partial_ {\mu} (\hat{n}_ {1} \times \hat{n}_ {2}) = \hat{n}_ {2}\cdot(\hat{n}_ {1}\times \partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {2}). \end{align*}\] <p>Note the change of notation between $\hat{n}$ and $\mathfrak{n}$. The expression for $k’$ is just that of $k$ but with $\mu$ and $\nu$ interchanged. Then,</p> \[\begin{align*} k_ {2}k_ {1}' =&amp; \hat{n}_ {2}\cdot( \partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}) \; \hat{n}_ {1}\cdot(\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n})\\ =&amp; (\partial_ {\mu }\hat{n}_ {2})\cdot \hat{n} \; (\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1})\cdot \hat{n}, \end{align*}\] <p>in the last line we have exploited the fact that $\hat{n}_ {1,2}$ and $\hat{n}$ are orthodox. Since $\hat{n}_ {2}$ has unit length, its derivative is orthodox to itself,</p> \[\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {2} = (\cdots) \hat{n}_ {1} + (\cdots)\hat{n}.\] <p>Similarly for $\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1}$. Then, since $\hat{n}_ {1}$ is orthodox to $\hat{n}_ {2}$, we have</p> \[\begin{align*} k_ {2}k_ {1}'=&amp; (\partial_ {\mu }\hat{n}_ {2})\cdot \hat{n} \; (\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1})\cdot \hat{n}\\ =&amp; (\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {2})\cdot(\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1}). \end{align*}\] <p>As a result,</p> \[\begin{align*} H_ {\mu \nu} &amp;= \frac{1}{g}(\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {2})\cdot(\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1}) - (\mu \leftrightarrow \nu) \\ &amp;=\frac{1}{g} \partial_ {\mu} (\hat{n}_ {2}\cdot\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1}) - (\mu\leftrightarrow \nu)\\ &amp;=: \partial_ {\mu} C_ {\nu} - \partial_ {\nu} C_ {\mu}. \end{align*}\] <p>where</p> \[C_ {\mu} := \frac{1}{g} \hat{n}_ {2} \cdot \partial_ {\mu} \hat{n}_ {1}.\] <p>In summary, we have</p> \[\begin{align*} \hat{F} &amp;= f_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} +H_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} ,\\ f_ {\mu \nu} &amp;= \partial_ {\mu}a_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}a_ {\mu},\\ H_ {\mu \nu} \mathfrak{n} &amp;=\frac{i}{g} [\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} ,\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} ],\\ H_ {\mu \nu} &amp;= \partial_ {\mu}C_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}C_ {\mu}, \; C_ {\mu}:= \frac{1}{g}\hat{n}_ {2}\cdot \partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {1}. \end{align*}\] <hr/> <p>We have talked about the monopole-like background $\mathcal{C}$ and the $U(1)$ field $\mathcal{A}$. The rest of the total $SU(N)$ gauge field can be symbolically denoted as $X$, thus we can separate the total gauge field $A$ into the following three parts,</p> \[A = \mathcal{A}+\mathcal{C}+X, \quad [X,\mathfrak{n} ]\neq0\] <p>where</p> <ul> <li>$A$ is the total $SU(N)$ field. This is sometimes denoted $\vec{A}$ when the gauge group is $SU(2)$.</li> <li>$\mathcal{A}$ is the free, massless $U(1)$ gauge field, so-called neuron.</li> <li>$\mathcal{C}$ is the monopole-like background field defined(fixed) by $\hat{n}$, where $\hat{n}$ for example can be chosen as the hedgehog-form, similar to the monopole field configuration. Possible singularity points are allowed. It do not fluctuated and has no dynamics.</li> <li>$X$ is the rest of $A$. I’d like to think of it as the non-abelian fluctuation about the background $\mathcal{C}$, but of course this is only a perturbative perspective.</li> </ul> <hr/> <p>$\hat{n}$ may not be globally defined. Let $\hat{n}_ {\infty}$ be the asymptotic field configuration at the spatial boundary $\partial\mathbb{R}^{3}=\mathbb{S}^{2}$. Since $\hat{n}$ takes value in all unit-norm vectors in all directions, the collection of all $\hat{n}$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^{2}$, think of it as the set of the end points of all possible $\hat{n}$. Thus,</p> \[\hat{n}_ {\infty}: \mathbb{S}^{2} \to \mathbb{S}^{2}.\] <p>If the winding number of $\hat{n}_ {\infty}$ is nonzero, then it can not be continuously deformed into a unit map. Then $\hat{n}$ can not be well-defined everywhere, there must be at least one singularity, where the direction of $\hat{n}$ is not defined. If $\hat{n}$ were a scalar field, we usually let it go to zero to avoid this problem, like with vortices.</p> <h2 id="gauge-transformation">Gauge transformation</h2> <p>If we fix the $\mathfrak{n}(x)$ field, then gauge group is broken to $SU(2)\to U(1)$, where $U(1)$ is the little group of $\mathfrak{n}(x)$, which depends on the position $x$. The unbroken $U(1)$ symmetry corresponds to the massless “photon” that survives at long distance. What if we do not fix $\mathfrak{n}(x)$, and allow it to gauge-transform freely? Then, under gauge transformation $\mathfrak{n}$ will rotate in a $x$-dependent way.</p> <p>To keep our notation in agree with others, let’s denote the gauge transformation matrix as $\Omega=e^{ i\alpha }$, where $\alpha=\alpha^{a}T^{a}$ is a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued <strong>infinitesimal</strong> vector. The gauge field $A$ transforms as</p> \[A \to A+ \frac{1}{g} D\alpha,\quad D_ {\mu}=\partial_ {\mu}-ig[A_ {\mu},-].\] <p>What about $\mathfrak{n}=\hat{n}^{a}T^{a}$? This $\mathfrak{g}$-valued field is not a part of the original Yang-Mills Lagrangian so it is not clear how it should transform under gauge transform, or if it should transform at all. For example at the beginning I thought that since $\hat{n}$ is a vector in physical space, why should it be affected by gauge transformation? Then again, since $\mathfrak{n}$ plays a similar rule to the Higgs boson, maybe it should transform as an adjoint scalar. That is what was adopted by Cho and other people, so I’ll stick to it.</p> <p>The Higgs-like field $\mathfrak{n}$ transforms under an infinitesimal gauge transformation as</p> \[\mathfrak{n} \to \mathfrak{n} +i[\alpha,\mathfrak{n} ] = \mathfrak{n} -\vec{\alpha}\times \hat{n}{\Large\mid}_ {\mathfrak{g} }.\] <p>The notation $\vec{\alpha}\times \hat{n}{\Large\mid}_ {\mathfrak{g}}$ means that $\vec{\alpha}\times \hat{n}$ is a vector in Lie algebra.</p> <hr/> <p>The background $\mathcal{C}$ together with $\mathcal{A}$ constitute the so-called restricted gauge field $\hat{A}$ that is bonded to the field $\mathfrak{n}$, in the sense that $\hat{A}$ is given by the solution of $D\mathfrak{n}=0$. After a gauge transformation, $\mathfrak{n}\to\mathfrak{n}’$ and $\hat{A}\to\hat{A}’$, but we would like the equation to hold independent of the gauge transformation, that is, after an arbitrary gauge transformation we want</p> \[D'\mathfrak{n} ' := (\partial-ig [\hat{A}',-])\,\mathfrak{n}' =\partial \mathfrak{n}' -ig [\hat{A}',\mathfrak{n}' ]=0.\] <p>This is guaranteed if we set $\hat{A}$ to transform as a regular gauge field</p> \[\hat{A}\to \hat{A}'=\Omega\left( \hat{A}+\frac{i}{g}\partial \right)\Omega ^{\dagger}.\] <p>while let $\mathfrak{n}$ transform as an adjoint scalar, \(\mathfrak{n} =\to \mathfrak{n'=\Omega \mathfrak{n} } \Omega ^{\dagger}.\) Now, as we wanted, $\hat{A}$ is the solution to $\mathcal{D}_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}=0$ in a <strong>gauge independent</strong> way: If $\hat{A}$ is a solution, after gauge transform, the transformed field $\hat{A}’$ still is a solution to $D’_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}’=0$.</p> <p>We also would like the decomposition of $\hat{A}$ to be gauge independent, that is after gauge transformation</p> \[\hat{A}' = \mathcal{A}' + \mathcal{C}'.\] <p>Let’s focus on $\mathcal{A}$ first. It is the $\mathfrak{n}$-direction projection of $\hat{A}$, that is</p> \[\mathcal{A}=a\mathfrak{n} , \quad a = 2\mathrm{Tr}\,(\mathfrak{n} \hat{A}) \equiv \hat{n} \cdot \hat{A},\] <p>the factor of $2$ is due to the normalization $\mathrm{Tr}\,T^{a}T^{b}=\frac{1}{2}\delta^{ab}$. <strong>This should be treated as the definition of $\mathcal{a}$, and this definition better be gauge independent</strong>, hence after gauge transformation we want</p> \[\mathcal{a}'=2\mathrm{Tr}\,(\mathfrak{n} '\hat{A}').\] <p>This will fix the gauge transformation rule for $\mathcal{A}$.

It is not simply $\mathcal{A}\to \Omega \mathcal{A}\Omega ^{\dagger}$, $\mathcal{C}\to \Omega(\mathcal{C}+i\partial)\Omega ^{\dagger}$.</p> <p>Another way to write the infinitesimal form of $\delta a$ in terms of $\mathcal{C}$ is as follows. Write the gauge transformation parameter as</p> \[\alpha = \alpha^{(1)} \mathfrak{n}_ {1} + \alpha^{(2)} \mathfrak{n} _ {2} + \theta \mathfrak{n} .\] <p>Since $\mathcal{C}=-\frac{1}{g}\hat{n}\times \partial \hat{n}$, it is orthodox to $\hat{n}$, write it in components of $\hat{n}_ {1}$ and $\hat{n}_ {2}$:</p> \[\mathcal{C}=: -\mathcal{C}^{(1)}\hat{n}_ {1} +- \mathcal{C}^{(2)} \hat{n}_ {2},\] <p>then</p> \[\mathcal{C}^{(2)} = -\hat{n}_ {2}\cdot \mathcal{C} = \frac{1}{g}\hat{n}_ {2}\cdot(\hat{n}\times \partial \hat{n}) = \frac{1}{g} \hat{n}(\partial \hat{n}\times \hat{n}_ {2})=\frac{1}{g}\hat{n}\cdot(\partial(-\hat{n}_ {1})-\hat{n}\times \partial \hat{n}_ {2}) = -\frac{1}{g}\hat{n}\cdot \partial \hat{n}_ {1},\] <p>and similarly</p> \[\mathcal{C}^{(1)} = \frac{1}{g} \hat{n}\cdot \partial \hat{n}_ {2}.\] <p>hence we have</p> \[\delta a = \frac{1}{g} \partial \theta - \alpha^{(1)} \mathcal{C}^{(2)} + \alpha^{(2)} \mathcal{C}^{(1)}.\] <p>define $C^{\pm}:= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\mathcal{C}^{(1)}\pm i\mathcal{C}^{(2)})$, we have</p> \[\delta a = \frac{1}{g} \partial \theta + i C^{+} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\alpha^{(1)}-i\alpha^{(2)}) - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} C^{-}(\alpha^{(1)} + i \alpha^{(2)}).\] <p>define</p> \[\alpha^{\pm } := \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\alpha^{(1)}\pm i \alpha^{(2)}),\] <p>we have</p> \[\delta a = \frac{1}{g} \partial \theta + iC^{+}\alpha^{-} - i C^{-}\alpha^{+}.\] <hr/> <p>To determine the gauge transform of $\mathcal{C}$, starting from the definition:</p> \[\mathcal{C} = \frac{i}{g} [\mathfrak{n} ,\partial \mathfrak{n} ] = \frac{2i}{g} \mathfrak{n} \partial \mathfrak{n}.\] <p>Under a gauge transform, $\mathfrak{n}\to \mathfrak{n}’=\Omega \mathfrak{n}\Omega ^{\dagger}$, consequently the transform of $\mathcal{C}$ in terms of $\mathfrak{n}$ should be</p> \[\frac{2i}{g} \mathfrak{n} \partial \mathfrak{n} \to \frac{2i}{g} \mathfrak{n}' \partial \mathfrak{n}' = \frac{2i}{g} \Omega \mathfrak{n} \Omega ^{\dagger}\partial(\Omega \mathfrak{n} \Omega ^{\dagger})\] <p>which is</p> \[\Omega \frac{2i}{g} \mathfrak{n} \partial \mathfrak{n} \Omega ^{\dagger} + \frac{i}{2g} \Omega \partial \Omega ^{\dagger} - \frac{2i}{g} (\Omega \mathfrak{n} \partial \Omega ^{\dagger})(\Omega \mathfrak{n} \Omega ^{\dagger}).\] <p>The question is, is this equivalent to another way to determine the gauge transformation of $\mathcal{C}$:</p> \[\hat{A}'=\mathcal{A}'+\mathcal{C}'\implies \mathcal{C}' = \hat{A}' - \mathcal{A}', \quad \mathcal{A}'=a'\mathfrak{n}'.\] <p>To answer it, let’s consider the simplest gauge transformation, that comprises of the little group of $\mathfrak{n}$, define $U:=\exp ik\mathfrak{n}$, where $k\in\mathbb{R}$. Under this gauge transformation, $\mathfrak{n}\to \mathfrak{n’} = U\mathfrak{n}U^{\dagger}$ remains unchanged, hence $\frac{2i}{g}\mathfrak{n}’\partial \mathfrak{n}’$ also remains unchanged. The infinitesimal form of the gauge transformation shows that</p> \[\hat{A}\to \hat{A}' = \left( a+\frac{1}{g} \partial k \right)\mathfrak{n} + \frac{2i}{g} \mathfrak{n} \partial \mathfrak{n}\] <p>showing that indeed the gauge transformed $\mathcal{C}’=\mathcal{C}$. The finite case is more complicated, we have</p> \[\hat{A}\to \hat{A}' = U\left( \mathcal{A}+ \mathcal{C} + \frac{i}{g}\partial \right) U ^{\dagger} = a\mathfrak{n} + \frac{2i}{g}\mathfrak{n} U\partial \mathfrak{n} U^{\dagger} + \frac{i}{g} U \partial U^{\dagger}.\] <p>Since $U = \exp ik\mathfrak{n}=\cos \frac{k}{2} \mathbb{1}_ {2}+2i\sin \frac{k}{2}\mathfrak{n}$, we have</p> \[\begin{align*} \frac{2i}{g}\mathfrak{n} U \partial \mathfrak{n} U^{\dagger} &amp;= \frac{2i}{g}\left( \mathfrak{n} \partial \mathfrak{n} \cos k + \frac{i}{2} \partial \mathfrak{n} \sin k \right),\\ \frac{i}{g}U \partial U^{\dagger} &amp;= \frac{i}{g}\left( -i\partial k\mathfrak{n} -i\partial \mathfrak{n} \sin k + 4\sin ^{2} \frac{k}{2} \,\mathfrak{n} \partial \mathfrak{n} \right). \end{align*}\] <p>Put everything together we get that</p> \[\hat{A} \to \hat{A}' = \left( a+\frac{\partial k}{g} \right)\mathfrak{n} + \mathcal{C},\quad \mathcal{C}=\frac{2i}{g}\mathfrak{n} \partial \mathfrak{n} .\] <p>Also, along the way I found two interesting formula:</p> \[\begin{align*} U \partial n U^{\dagger} &amp;= i 2 \mathfrak{n} \partial \mathfrak{n} \sinh k + \partial \mathfrak{n} \cosh k ,\\ \partial U U^{\dagger} &amp;= \int_ {0}^{1} ds U^{1-s}\partial(ikn) (U^{\dagger})^{1-s}. \end{align*}\] <hr/> <p>Regarding $X$ in $A = \mathcal{A}+\mathcal{C}+X$. $X$ also transforms as a adjoint scalar,</p> \[X\to \Omega X \Omega ^{\dagger}.\] <p>How the field transforms tells us what gauge invariant terms we could construct to be included into the Lagrangian, for instance, we know that $\left\lvert D_ {\mu}X \right\rvert^{2}$ is gauge invariant, so they could appear in the Lagrangian.</p> <p>The infinitesimal form of $X$ is similar to that of $\mathfrak{n}$: $X\to X’ = -i[\alpha,X]$.</p> <p>To fix this gauge condition we may choose the generalized Lorentz condition,</p> \[\partial_ {\mu}\hat{A}_ {\mu}=0\] <p>which in components proportional and perpendicular to $\mathfrak{n}$ reads</p> \[\begin{align*} \partial a_ {\mu} &amp;= 0, \\ \hat{n}\times \partial^{2}\hat{n} - g a_ {\mu} \partial_ {\mu}\hat{n} &amp;= 0. \end{align*}\] <p>This way of defining the gauge transformation is referred to as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">active gauge transformation</code>, since it actively changes the orientation of $\hat{n}$.</p> <hr/> <p>Another possible gauge symmetry, so-called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">passive gauge transformation</code>, reads</p> \[\begin{align*} \delta \hat{n} &amp;=0, \quad \delta A_ {\mu} = \frac{1}{g} \hat{n}\cdot D_ {\mu}\vec{\alpha},\\ \delta \hat{A}_ {\mu} &amp;= \frac{1}{g}(\hat{n}\cdot D_ {\mu}\hat{\alpha})\hat{n},\\ \delta \vec{X}_ {\mu} &amp;= \frac{1}{g}[D_ {\mu}\vec{\alpha}-(\hat{n}\cdot D_ {\mu} \vec{\alpha})\hat{n}], \end{align*}\] <p>where $A_ {\mu}:=\hat{n}\cdot \vec{A}_ {\mu}$.</p> <p>In general, given an arbitrary $\hat{n}$, there exists different decomposition of gauge transformation that preserves the defining equation $D\mathfrak{n}=0$ besides the standard one.</p> <hr/> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">generalized Lorentz gauge</code> condition is defined to be</p> \[\partial_ {\mu}\hat{A}_ {\mu}=0,\] <p>substitute the definition $\hat{A}=\mathcal{A}+\mathcal{C}$, we have</p> \[\begin{align*} (\partial_ {\mu} a_ {\mu} )\mathfrak{n} =&amp; 0 , \\ a_ {\mu} \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} +i[\mathfrak{n} ,\partial^{2}\mathfrak{n} ]=&amp;0. \end{align*}\] <h2 id="lagrangian-of-restricted-and-extended-qcd">Lagrangian of Restricted and Extended QCD</h2> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">restricted QCD</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RCD</code> for short, is the self-energy of restricted gauge field $\hat{A}$,</p> \[\mathcal{L}_ {\text{RCD}} = - \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Tr}\,\hat{F}_ {\mu \nu}^{2}.\] <p>Substitute in</p> \[\begin{align*} \hat{F} &amp;= f_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} +H_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} ,\\ f_ {\mu \nu} &amp;= \partial_ {\mu}a_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}a_ {\mu},\\ H_ {\mu \nu} \mathfrak{n} &amp;=\frac{i}{g} [\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} ,\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} ]. \end{align*}\] <p>we have</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathcal{L}_ {\text{RCD}} =&amp; - \frac{1}{4}f_ {\mu \nu}^{2} - \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Tr}\,H^{2} - \mathrm{Tr}\,f_ {\mu \nu}H^{\mu \nu}\\ =&amp; - \frac{1}{4} (\partial_ {\mu}a_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}a_ {\mu})^{2}\\ &amp; - \frac{1}{4g^{2}}(\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}\times \partial_ {\nu}\hat{n})^{2}\\ &amp;+ \frac{1}{2g} \epsilon^{abc}f_ {\mu \nu}\hat{n}^{a}\partial^{\mu}\hat{n}^{b}\partial^{\nu}\hat{n}^{c} \end{align*}.\] <p>OK, now let’s include the final piece, the non-abelian fluctuation $X$.

We can write</p> \[\begin{align*} \hat{D}_ {\mu} \vec{X}_ {\nu} &amp;= \hat{n}_ {\alpha} (\partial_ {\mu} X_ {\nu}^{(\alpha)} - g a_ {\mu} \epsilon_ {\alpha \beta} X_ {\nu}^{(\beta)}) +\hat{n}_ {\beta} \left\lvert \epsilon_ {\alpha \beta} \right\rvert \hat{n}_ {\beta}\cdot \partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {\alpha} X_ {\nu}^{(\alpha)} \\ &amp;= \hat{n}_ {\alpha}[\partial_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}^{(\alpha)}-(g a_ {\mu}\epsilon_ {\alpha \beta}-\left\lvert \epsilon_ {\alpha \beta} \right\rvert \hat{n}_ {\alpha} \cdot \partial_ {\mu} \hat{n}_ {\beta})X_ {\nu}^{(\beta)}]. \end{align*}\] <p>Notice that there is no $\hat{n}$ component, only $\hat{n}_ {1}$ and $\hat{n}_ {2}$. Substitute $\chi,\chi ^\ast$ for $X^{(1,2)}$, let $\alpha=1$, $\beta=2$ we have</p> \[\partial_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}^{(1)}-(g a_ {\mu}\epsilon_ {12}-\left\lvert \epsilon_ {12} \right\rvert \hat{n}_ {1} \cdot \partial_ {\mu} \hat{n}_ {2})X_ {\nu}^{(2)} =: \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(D_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}+(D_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu})^\ast)\] <p>where the covariant derivative acting on $\chi$ is defined by</p> \[D_ {\mu}\chi := \partial_ {\mu} \chi_ {\nu} +i(g a_ {\mu}-\hat{n}_ {1}\cdot \partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {2})\chi_ {\nu}.\] <p>Similarly, let $\alpha,\beta=2,1$ we have</p> \[\partial_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}^{(2)}-(g a_ {\mu}\epsilon_ {21}-\left\lvert \epsilon_ {21} \right\rvert \hat{n}_ {2} \cdot \partial_ {\mu} \hat{n}_ {1})X_ {\nu}^{(1)} = - \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}(D_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}-\text{c.c.}).\] <p>Substitute this to the term in the Lagrangian, we have</p> \[\begin{align*} &amp;(\hat{D}_ {\mu}\vec{X}_ {\nu}-(\mu \leftrightarrow \nu))^{2}\\ &amp;= \sum_ {\alpha=1,2}\left\lbrace [\partial_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}^{(\alpha)}-(a_ {\mu}\epsilon_ {\alpha \beta}-\left\lvert \epsilon_ {\alpha \beta} \right\rvert \hat{n}_ {\alpha} \cdot \partial_ {\mu} \hat{n}_ {\beta})X_ {\nu}^{(\beta)}] -(\mu \leftrightarrow \nu) \right\rbrace ^{2}\\ &amp;= 2\left\lvert D_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}-D_ {\nu}\chi_ {\mu} \right\rvert ^{2}. \end{align*}\] <p>This simplification is quite impressive.</p> <p>We can also write</p> \[D_ {\mu}\chi = \partial_ {\mu} \chi +ig B_ {\mu} \chi\] <p>where $B$ is a new field defined as</p> \[B_ {\mu} := a_ \mu + C_ {\mu}, \quad \hat{F}_ {\mu \nu} = \partial_ {\mu}B_ {\nu} - \partial_ {\nu}B_ {\mu}.\] <hr/> <p>The gauge transformation of $\chi$ is particularly simple. Regarding the components $X^{(1,2)}$, we have</p> \[X^{(1,2)}\to 2\mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace \Omega\mathfrak{n} _ {1,2} \Omega ^{\dagger} \Omega X \Omega ^{\dagger} \right\rbrace =X^{(1,2)},\] <p>hence under gauge transformation</p> \[\chi\to \chi'=\chi.\] <hr/> <p>Next let’s consider a special case just to verify our result above. <em>If $\hat{n}$ is independent of spacetime,</em> then without loss of generality we can assume that $\hat{n}$ lies in the $T^{3}$ direction, $\hat{n}_ {1}$ in $T^{1}$ and $\hat{n}_ {2}$ in $T^{2}$ respectively in $\mathfrak{su}(2)$. $X=X^{1}\mathfrak{n}_ {1}+X^{2}\mathfrak{n}_ {2}$ becomes $X=X^{1}T^{1}+X^{2}T^{2}$. $\hat{A}=a_ {\mu}T^{3}$ since $\mathcal{C}$ vanishes, and as a consequence so does $H_ {\mu \nu}$.</p> <p>We can write down the three components of $\hat{D}_ {\mu}\vec{X}_ {\nu}$ easily:</p> \[\begin{align*} \text{1-component=}&amp; \partial_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}^{1} - g\hat{A}_ {\mu}^{3}X_ {\nu}^{2}, \\ \text{2-component=}&amp; \partial_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}^{2} + g\hat{A}_ {\mu}^{3}X_ {\nu}^{1}, \\ \text{3-component=}&amp; 0. \end{align*}\] <p>The last one is zero since $\hat{A}^{1,2}=0$. Thus</p> \[\begin{align*} &amp;(\hat{D}_ {\mu}\vec{X}_ {\nu}-(\mu \leftrightarrow \nu))^{2}\\ =&amp; \text{1-component}^{2}+\text{2-component}^{2}\\ =&amp; \text{1-component}^{2}-(i\times \text{2-component})^{2}\\ =&amp; (\text{1-compnent}+i\times \text{2-compnent})(\text{1-compnent}-i\times \text{2-compnent}) \\ =&amp; [(\partial_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}^{1}+\partial_ {\mu}iX_ {\nu}^{2}+ig\hat{A}_ {\mu}^{3}(X_ {\nu}^{1}+iX_ {\nu}^{2}))-(\mu \leftrightarrow \nu)]\\ =&amp; 2[\partial_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}+ig\hat{A}_ {\mu}^{3}\chi_ {\nu}-(\mu \leftrightarrow \nu)] [\partial_ {\mu}\chi ^\ast _ {\nu}-ig\hat{A}_ {\mu}^{3}\chi ^\ast _ {\nu}-(\mu \leftrightarrow \nu)]\\ =&amp; 2[\partial_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}+ig\hat{A}_ {\mu}^{3}\chi_ {\nu}-(\mu \leftrightarrow \nu)]\times (\text{h.c.}) \end{align*}\] <p>Recall that $\hat{A}^{3}=a$. Define the hatted covariant derivative for $\chi$ as</p> \[\hat{D}_ {\mu} \chi_ {\nu} := \partial_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu} +i g a_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}\] <p>we have</p> \[(\hat{D}_ {\mu}\vec{X}_ {\nu}-(\mu \leftrightarrow \nu))^{2} = 2\left\lvert \hat{D}_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}-\hat{D}_ {\nu}\chi_ {\mu} \right\rvert ^{2}.\] <p>Finally, in the special case where $(\hat{n}_ {1},\hat{n}_ {2},\hat{n})=(T^{1},T^{2},T^{3})$, the Lagrangian for extended QCD now reads (in terms of $\chi$):</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathcal{L}_ {\text{ECD}} =&amp; - \frac{1}{4}(f_ {\mu \nu}+H_ {\mu \nu}+X_ {\mu \nu})^{2} - \frac{1}{2} \left\lvert \hat{D}_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}-\hat{D}_ {\nu}\chi_ {\mu} \right\rvert ^{2} \end{align*}\] <hr/> <p>The equations of motion in terms of $\chi$ can be straightforwardly obtained. We can write $\hat{D}_ {\mu}\vec{X}_ {\nu}-\hat{D}_ {\nu}\vec{X}_ {\mu}$ in terms of $\chi$, explicitly expanded in basis $\hat{n}_ {1}$ and $\hat{n}_ {2}$,</p> \[\begin{align*} \hat{D}_ {\mu}\vec{X}_ {\nu}-\hat{D}_ {\nu}\vec{X}_ {\mu} &amp;= \hat{n}_ {1} \left[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{D}_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}-\hat{D}_ {\nu}\chi_ {\mu})+\text{h.c.} \right] \\ &amp;\quad\;\, + \hat{n}_ {2}\left( -\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \right)[(\hat{D}_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu} - \hat{D}_ {\nu}\chi_ {\mu}) - \text{h.c.}] \end{align*}\] <p>We have</p> \[\boxed{ \partial_ {\mu}\Gamma_ {\mu \nu} = ig [\chi_ {\mu} ^\ast (\hat{D}_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}-\hat{D}_ {\nu}\chi_ {\mu}) - \text{h.c.}], \quad \Gamma_ {\mu \nu} := f_ {\mu \nu}+H_ {\mu \nu}+X_ {\mu \nu}. }\] <p>Define $K := (\hat{D}_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}-\hat{D}_ {\nu}\chi_ {\mu})/\sqrt{2}$ we have</p> \[\begin{align*} \hat{D}_ {\mu} (\hat{D}_ {\mu}\vec{X}_ {\nu}-\hat{D}_ {\nu}\vec{X}_ {\mu}) &amp;= (\partial_ {\mu}+g \hat{A}_ {\mu}\times )(\hat{D}X-\hat{D}X)\\ &amp;= \hat{n}_ {1}(-i\hat{n}_ {1}\cdot \partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {2} + ig a_ {\mu} + \partial_ {\mu})(K-K^\ast )\\ &amp; \quad \;\, + \hat{n}_ {2}(-\hat{n}_ {1}\cdot \partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {2} + g a_ {\mu} -i \partial_ {\mu})(K-K^\ast )\\ &amp;= \hat{n}_ {1}\hat{D}_ {\mu} (K-K^\ast ) + \hat{n}_ {2}(-i) \hat{D}_ {\mu} (K-K^\ast ). \end{align*}\] <p>By comparing the components, we have the following EoM:</p> \[\boxed{ \hat{D}_ {\mu}(\hat{D}_ {\mu}\chi_ {\nu}-\hat{D}_ {\nu}\chi_ {\mu}) = ig \Gamma_ {\mu \nu} \, \chi_ {\mu}, \quad \Gamma_ {\mu \nu} := f_ {\mu \nu}+H_ {\mu \nu}+X_ {\mu \nu}. }\] <p>If $X=0$ and $a=0$, then the EoM becomes $\partial_ {\mu}H_ {\mu \nu}=0$, in terms of $\hat{n}$ it reads</p> \[\hat{n}\cdot(\partial^{2}\hat{n}\times \partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}+\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}\times (\partial_ {\mu}\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n})) = 0.\] <p>This is the constraint for $\hat{n}$ in the absence of other fields.</p> <h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1>]]></content><author><name>Baiyang Zhang</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Convention]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Calculating States Using Diagrams</title><link href="https://baiyangzhang.github.io/blog/2025/Calculating-States-Using-Diagrams/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Calculating States Using Diagrams"/><published>2025-10-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://baiyangzhang.github.io/blog/2025/Calculating-States-Using-Diagrams</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://baiyangzhang.github.io/blog/2025/Calculating-States-Using-Diagrams/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>We introduce a diagrammatic techniques in calculating the ….

The diagrams for $H_ {\bullet}$ comprises of a set of vertices, while the diagram for $\left\lvert \psi \right\rangle$ is assumedly known. We need to enumerate all possible ways to attach all vertices to the state diagram. Each red circle from the vertices needs to be connected to another let to form a propagator, otherwise the diagram vanishes. After the connections are made, momenta conservation must hold at each vertex and circle. The procedure is as follows. 1) Identify the diagrams, label all independent momenta. 2) Set up the configuration. Place the vertex diagrams on the left and state on the right, enumerate all possible ways of connecting the circles to the legs from state, forming new diagrams. If multiple equivalent connections exist for the same diagram, their number defines the symmetry factor. 3) Label manipulation. A circle connecting two independently momenta (simply two labels in our notation) is fully labeled; one connects to only a single label is half-labeled. Arrange the labels so that as many circles as possible are fully labeled. Each fully labeled circle conserves the momenta, thus a pair of connected label and circle cancel each other. Remove the circle together with one of the connected momentum labels, then replace the removed circle with an arrow indicating the direction of increasing coupling, yielding a regular propagator. Any circle that can not be removed corresponding to a singular propagator, contributing a factor of $\int d^{3}x$ or equivalently $(2\pi)^{3}\delta^{3}(0)$. 4) Construct the expression. Apply momentum conservation at each vertex to fix the momenta of propagators and external legs. Read the diagram from left to right, include the symmetry factor. The final state can be read off from the leftmost external legs, each corresponds to a momentum eigenvalue. For every independent momentum, write down the integral with measure $\int d^{3}p_ {i} / (2\pi)^{3}$, where $i$ is the corresponding momentum label; for every vertex and propagator, write down the corresponding factors. Finally write down the initial state, this will complete the process and gives us the complete expression.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/img/kink/jarahRules-480.webp 480w,/img/kink/jarahRules-800.webp 800w,/img/kink/jarahRules-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/img/kink/jarahRules.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Rules for two kinds of propagators, regular and circled ones.

Whenever the <strong>non-abelian</strong> gauge group is broken to its <strong>Cartan subgroup</strong> (Cartan subalgebra is spanned by a maximal mutual-commuting basis of Lie algebra) by adjoint Higgs bosons, we have magnetic monopoles. The <strong>adjoint</strong> Higgs fields have non-zero vacuum expectation values (VEV for short, denoted by $\left\langle \bullet \right\rangle$), breaking the gauge symmetry. Those gauge transformations that leave $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle$ invariant are symmetries not broken by the Higgs bosons. Loosely speaking there are two kinds of symmetries:</p> <ul> <li>the symmetry of the Lagrangian,</li> <li>the symmetry of the vacuum.</li> </ul> <p>What about gauge symmetry? Gauge symmetry is not really a symmetry, rather it is a redundancy, corresponds to the freedom of a change of basis.</p> <p>Sometimes, a symmetry is preserved in the Lagrangian but not the vacuum, meaning that the symmetry will change the vacuum, e.g. the double well potential in quantum mechanics, the $x \leftrightarrow -x$ symmetry doesn’t change the Lagrangian, but it turn one vacuum to the other, thus it is not a symmetry of the vacuum. In this case we say this symmetry is spontaneously broken. Of course, since the spontaneously broken symmetry is still a symmetry of the Hamiltonian, it only takes one vacuum (minimal energy) to another. In more mathematical terms, let $H$ be the broken symmetry and $\phi_ {0}$ be any vacuum configuration, the orbit of $H$ acting on $\phi_ {0}$ is the vacuum manifold, or at least a connected submanifold of vacuum.</p> <p>Why should we start with $SU(2)$ monopole? because</p> <ul> <li>it is the simplest monopole in Yang-Mills theory, and</li> <li>$SU(2)$ monopole solution is the building block for monopole solutions in larger groups.</li> </ul> <p>In $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory, the generator is $T^a = \frac{1}{2}\sigma^a$, where $\sigma$’s are the Pauli matrices, with inner product defined by the trace:</p> \[\left\langle T^{a} \middle\vert T^b \right\rangle := \text{Tr }{T^a T^b} = \frac{1}{2}\delta^{ab}\] <p>Besides the gauge field, let us add the triplet Higgs scalar in the adjoint representation,</p> \[\phi = \frac{\sigma^a}{2}\phi^a\] <p>with convention $\left\lvert \phi \right\rvert^{2} := \phi^a \phi^a = 2\text{Tr }(\phi^2)$. In our convention, if $\phi$ without absolute value notation is squared, we are simply squaring the matrix field itself, while if $\left\lvert \phi \right\rvert$ is squared, we are doing the module square.</p> <p>The action is</p> \[S = \int d^4 x \, \left\lbrace {-\frac{1}{2e^2}\text{Tr }F_ {\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}+ \frac{1}{e^2}\mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lvert D_ \mu \phi \right\rvert ^2-V(\phi)}\right\rbrace,\] <p>where</p> \[V(\phi) = - \mu^2 \text{Tr }{\phi^2} + \lambda(\text{Tr }{\phi^2})^2 = -\frac{\mu^2}{2}\phi^a \phi^a +\frac{\lambda}{4}(\phi^a \phi^a )^2,\] <p>the vacuum manifold is $\mathbb{S}^{2}$. To see this we can complete the square</p> \[V = \frac{\lambda}{4} \left( \phi^a\phi^a-v^2 \right)^2-\frac{\mu^4}{4\lambda}, \quad v^2 = \frac{\mu^2}{\lambda},\] <p>If $v^{2}&lt;0$, the model is in confined phase. We will assume that $v^{2}&gt;0$, so the theory sits in the Higgs phase. One possible vacuum is obtained at</p> \[\left\langle \phi^{1} \right\rangle = \left\langle \phi^2 \right\rangle = 0,\, \left\langle \phi^3 \right\rangle = v,\, \left\langle A \right\rangle = 0.\] <p>The VEV of $\vec{\phi}$ field points to the $z$-direction. Now the gauge symmetry $SU(2)$ is broken to $U(1)$, since the vacuum for the Higgs is $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle=\phi^{3}T^{3}$ and only the gauge transformation given by $e^{i\theta^3 T^3}$ preserves the vacuum:</p> \[SU(2) \to U(1).\] <p>It is often useful to borrow the terminologies from QED, separating the field strength into “magnetic” and “electric” part,</p> \[\begin{align*} B_ i &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \epsilon_ {ijk}F_ {jk},\\ E_ i &amp;= F_ {0i}. \end{align*}\] <p>Note that in Yang-Mills theory, $B$ and $E$ are matrices and they are not gauge invariant, in contrast to $U(1)$ theory. It means that $B,E$ are no longer physical observables (which must be gauge invariant), such as the trace of $F_ {\mu\nu}^2$ or the Wilson loops.</p> <p>Since we have chosen the vacuum to be $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle = v T^3$, in the unitary gauge, the degrees of freedom are</p> <ul> <li>two massive gauge bosons, $W_ \mu^\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(A_ \mu^1 \pm i A_ \mu^2)$. The mass comes solely from the covariant derivative $\left\lvert D_ \mu \phi \right\rvert^2$, after shifting $\phi^3$ to $\phi^3 + v$, the coupling between A and $\phi^3$ is</li> </ul> \[\frac{1}{2}\frac{v^2}{e^2}A_ \mu^a A^{a\mu}\equiv \frac{1}{2}m_ W^2 A^2,\quad a = 1,2\] <ul> <li>$A^3$ remains massless, it is the “photon” decoupled from $\phi^3$</li> <li>$\phi^3$ particle is electrically neutral.</li> </ul> <p>For the total energy to be finite, it must be that at spatial infinity, the field configuration goes to a vacuum configuration fast enough:</p> \[\left\lvert \phi \right\rvert \to v,\quad \left\lvert D_ \mu \phi \right\rvert ^2 \to 0, \quad A \to i \Omega \partial_ \mu\Omega^{-1}.\] <p>Note that $\left\lvert D_ \mu \phi \right\rvert^2$ must drop to zero faster than $r^{-3/2}$ to make the total energy finite.</p> <p>The topology of the space boundary is $\mathbb{S}^2$ since $\partial \mathbb{R}^3 = \mathbb{S}^2$. The vacuum manifold of the Higgs field is also $\mathbb{S}^2$, thus the Higgs field at $r \to \infty$ is a map $\mathbb{S}^2 \to \mathbb{S}^2$, which is classified by homotopy group $\pi_ 2(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}$, where $\mathbb{Z}$ is the addition group of integers. We can use homotopy to classify topologically different solutions, labeling any finite energy Higgs configuration by an integer $n$, which counts the winding number of Higgs field at infinity. Given a $\phi$ field configuration, Let $\hat{\phi}^{i} \equiv \phi^{i} / \left\lvert \phi \right\rvert$ be the unit field vector, the winding number is give by integrating the <em>pullback</em> of the volume in $\phi$ configuration space:</p> \[\boxed{ n = \frac{1}{8\pi}\epsilon_ {ijk} \epsilon_ {abc} \int d^2S_ i \, \hat{\phi}^{a}\partial_ {j} \hat{\phi}^{b}\partial_ {k} \hat{\phi}^{c} }\] <p>The trivial vacuum where $\phi = \text{const}$ everywhere obviously has $n = 0$.</p> <p>Consider the case where the winding number $n=1$. $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle$ at infinity depends on the direction. The residual U(1) symmetry of $SU(2)$ consists of the elements that commutes with $\left\langle \phi \right\rangle$, thus the unbroken $U(1)$ direction also depends on the position. Recall that $A_ \mu = A_ \mu^a T^a$ as a $\mathfrak{su}(2)$-valued field, the components of $A_ {\mu}$ that commutes with $\phi$ can be projected out (in any direction) via</p> \[a_ \mu = \frac{2}{v} \text{Tr }{\phi A_ \mu},\] <p>for example, if $\phi = v T^3, \, a_ \mu = A_ \mu^3$.</p> <p>The unbroken U(1) component can be regarded as a vector in the Lie-algebra whose direction, after choosing a vacuum $\phi_ {0}$, is parallel to $\phi_ {0}$. For example, if $\phi_ {0}$ is chosen to be $vT^3$, then the unbroken U(1) group is proportional to $T^3$. Again, in the case of a monopole solution, the U(1) direction is position-dependent.</p> <p>Let’s look at the covariant derivative. In order to make sure that $\left\lvert D_ \mu\phi \right\rvert^{2} = \left\lvert \partial_ \mu\phi-i[A_ \mu,\phi] \right\rvert^{2} \to 0$, we need to find a corresponding $A_ \mu$ that can cancel the $\partial_ \mu \phi$, for $\phi = v \hat{\phi}$.</p> <p>The following identities might be helpful:</p> \[\phi^2 = \phi^a T^a \phi^b T^b = \frac{1}{2}\phi^a\phi^b \left\lbrace T^a ,T^b \right\rbrace= \boxed{ \frac{v^2}{4}=\phi^{2}}.\] <p>For Pauli matrices we have</p> \[\sigma^i \sigma^j = \delta^{ij} + i \epsilon^{ijk}\sigma^k.\] <p>If $\phi^{2}$ is constant, we have</p> \[\partial_ \mu \phi^2 = 0 = \left\lbrace \partial_ \mu \phi,\phi \right\rbrace\] <p>thus</p> \[[\partial_ \mu \phi,\phi] = -2\phi\partial_ \mu \phi\] <p>and</p> \[\left[ [\partial_ \mu \phi,\phi],\phi \right] = v^2 \partial_ \mu \phi.\] <p>Let</p> \[\boxed{ A_ \mu = -\frac{i}{v^2} [\partial_ \mu \phi,\phi]+\frac{a_ \mu}{v}\phi, }\] <p>then</p> \[-i [A_ \mu,\phi] = - \partial_ \mu \phi,\] <p>$a_ \mu$ above is the same as the unbroken U(1) field. We see that $A_ {\mu}$ is the asymptotic gauge field.</p> <p>Knowing the asymptotic form of the gauge field, we can work out the asymptotic form of $F_ {\mu\nu}$, however we are mostly interested in the U(1) part, that is the field strength in the same direction of $\phi$,</p> \[\begin{align} \notag F_ {\mu\nu} &amp;= \partial_ \mu A_ \nu-\partial_ \nu A_ \mu-i[{A_ \mu},{A_ \nu}]\\ &amp;= \frac{\phi}{v}(\partial_ \mu a_ \nu - \partial_ \nu a_ \mu )+\frac{i}{v^2}[{\partial_ \mu \phi},{\partial_ \nu \phi}] + \frac{a_ \mu }{v} \partial_ \nu \phi - \frac{a_ \nu }{v} \partial_ \mu \phi \end{align}\] <p>The last two terms are orthogonal to $\phi$ thus we can discard them. Writing</p> \[F_ {\mu\nu} = \cdots + f_ {\mu\nu}\frac{\phi}{v}\] <p>where</p> \[f_ {\mu\nu} = \partial_ \mu a_ \nu - \partial_ \mu a_ \nu +\frac{2i}{v^3}\text{Tr }{\phi[{\partial_ \mu \phi},{\partial_ \nu \phi}]}\] <p>is the U(1) field strength. The corresponding magnetic field is</p> \[B_ i = -\frac{1}{2} \epsilon_ {ijk}f_ {jk} = \cdots + \frac{1}{2v^3}\epsilon_ {ijk}\epsilon_ {abc}\phi^a \partial_ j \phi^{b}\partial_ {k} \phi^{c}\] <p>The last term is a surprise since it comes from the non-abelian part, whose contribution to the magnetic charge is proportional to the topological charge</p> \[m = \int d^2S_ i\, B_ i = \frac{1}{2} \int d^2S_ i\, \epsilon_ {ijk}\epsilon_ {abc}\hat{\phi}^a \partial_ j \hat{\phi}^{b}\partial_ {k} \hat{\phi}^{c} = 4\pi n\] <p>where n is the winding number. The $\partial_ \mu a_ \nu - \partial_ \mu a_ \nu$ term doesn’t contribution to the magnetic charge since its contribution to the magnetic field is a curl, whose divergence vanishes. Such solution with a quantized U(1) magnetic charge goes by the name ‘t Hooft-Polyakov monopole.</p> <hr/> <p>Above we have given a general analyses, to find the explicit monopole solution, we introduce the hedgehog ansatz for winding number $n = 1$, a natural guess for the solution for $\phi$:</p> \[\phi^i = v \hat{x}^i h(r), \quad h(r) \to \begin{cases} 1 &amp; r \to \infty \\ 0 &amp; r \to 0 \end{cases}.\] <p>We can find corresponding $A_ \mu$ at spacial infinity by solving</p> \[D_ i \phi = 0 \implies \partial_ i \hat{x}^a + \epsilon_ {abd}A_ \mu^b \hat{x}^c = 0\] <p>by multiplying both sides by $x_ j \epsilon_ {adj}$.

This approach is called the Abelian projection.</p> <p>Abelian projection is a method that extracts an Abelian $U(1)^{N-1}$ theory (for gauge group $SU(N)$) from a non-Abelian gauge theory like QCD by <em>partially fixing the gauge</em> so that only the Cartan subgroup (the maximal torus group) remains unbroken.</p> <p>There is strong evidence that confinement may be related to the concept of dual superconductivity, where the QCD vacuum behaves like a type-II superconductor with condensation of magnetic monopoles. In electrodynamics, magnetic charges and electric charges are treated symmetrically in Maxwell’s equations. In QCD, however:</p> <ul> <li>The electric sector corresponds to the color charges carried by quarks.</li> <li>The magnetic sector involves topological objects like monopoles that arise from the non-Abelian nature of the gauge group.</li> </ul> <p>The idea behind the Abelian projection is that even though QCD is a non-Abelian theory, its <strong>long-distance behavior</strong> might be dominated by Abelian degrees of freedom, similar to how superconductors exhibit Abelian gauge behavior.</p> <p>The Abelian projection involves fixing the gauge partially, such that only the maximal Abelian subgroup (Cartan subgroup) remains unbroken. Take $SU(3)$ QCD for example. The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ consists of eight generators $T^a (a=1,…,8)$, corresponding to eight gluon fields $A_ \mu^a$. Its Cartan subgroup consists of diagonal elements that form a maximal Abelian subgroup:</p> \[U(1)^{N-1} \subset SU(N).\] <p>For SU(3), the maximal Abelian subgroup is $U(1) \times U(1)$, generated by the two diagonal Gell-Mann matrices $T^3$ and $T^8$.</p> <hr/> <p>Gauge fixing means choosing a specific gauge transformation to simplify the theory while preserving essential physics. In Abelian projection, we choose a gauge-fixing condition that preserves only the Cartan subgroup.</p> <p>A common choice is to diagonalize a field like the Polyakov loop $P(x)$ or the adjoint Higgs field in the fundamental representation:</p> \[P(x) = \mathcal{P} \exp \left( i \int_ 0^\beta A_ 0(x, t) dt \right),\] <p>where $A_0$ is the time component of the gauge field and $\mathcal{P}$ denotes path ordering. By fixing a gauge such that $P(x)$ is diagonal, the remaining gauge freedom consists only of transformations in the Cartan subgroup (because $T^{3}$ and $T^{8}$ are also diagonal), effectively reducing the theory to an Abelian gauge theory.</p> <hr/> <p>After Abelian projection,</p> <ol> <li> <p>The gauge fields decompose into <strong>diagonal (Abelian) components</strong> and <strong>off-diagonal (charged) components</strong>:</p> \[A_ \mu = A_ \mu^{\text{diag}} + A_ \mu^{\text{off-diag}}.\] <p>The diagonal fields behave like photons in electromagnetism, while the off-diagonal fields carry color charge.</p> </li> <li> <p>Magnetic Monopoles Appear Naturally: The gauge fixing makes topological excitations like magnetic monopoles manifest.</p> </li> <li> <p>Supports the Dual Superconductor Picture: In a superconductor, electric charges form Cooper pairs that condense, leading to the <strong>Meissner effect</strong> (expulsion of magnetic fields).

Consider The $\mathfrak{g}$-valued gauge potential, decompose it to the abelian sub-algebra, namely the Cartan subalgebra, and the rest part that is orthogonal to it. Introduce a <strong>right-handed orthonormal frame</strong> $(\hat{n}^{1},\hat{n}^{2},\hat{n}^{3})$ with $\hat{n}^{i}\hat{n}^{i}=1$. Choose the third component to be the so-called abelian direction, denoted it by $\hat{n}:=\hat{n}^{3}$. This notation is a bit confusing I know, but this is used in the original papers. Next, let’s put the vectors into Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, via assigning each component $\hat{n}^{i}$ to a basis $T^{a}\in\mathfrak{g}$, $T^{a} = \frac{\sigma^{a}}{2}$ for $SU(2)$. In order to cling to the convention that fraktur letters are used to denote Lie algebra, let’s write $\mathfrak{n}$ for the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued unit vector $\hat{n}$, i.e. $\mathfrak{n}:= \hat{n}^{i}T^{i}$. Now we can treat $\mathfrak{n}$ as a static adjoint field, and act the covariant derivative on $\mathfrak{n}$, just as acting covariant derivative on $\mathfrak{g}$-valued scalar fields. Furthermore, similar to what we did at the presence of a monopole, we can decompose the gauge field into two parts, that satisfies $D_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}=0$ and that does not. With the help of the following matrix identities:</p> \[\mathfrak{n}^{2}=\mathfrak{n}\cdot \mathfrak{n}=\hat{n}^{a}\hat{n}^{b}T^{a}T^{b}=\frac{1}{4}\mathbb{1}_ {2},\quad T:=\frac{1}{2}\sigma\] <p>and consequently</p> \[\partial \mathfrak{n}^{2}=0=(\partial \mathfrak{n})\mathfrak{n}+\mathfrak{n}\partial \mathfrak{n}\implies \partial \mathfrak{n} \mathfrak{n} = -\mathfrak{n}\partial \mathfrak{n},\] <p>we can solve the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued equation $D_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}=0$ for $A_ {\mu}$, like we did for the $SU(2)$ monopole in the previous chapter. Expand the covariant derivative,</p> \[D_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} = (\partial_ {\mu}-i[A,-])\mathfrak{n} = \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}-i[A_ {\mu},\mathfrak{n}]=0,\] <p>we see that the solution can be written as the summation of the parallel part that is proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$, and the perpendicular part that is perpendicular to $\mathfrak{n}$. Some derivation shows that</p> \[[[\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n},\mathfrak{n}],\mathfrak{n}] = \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n},\] <p>thus the non-trivial part of the solution for $A_ {\mu}$, call it $\mathcal{C}_ {\mu}$, reads</p> \[\boxed{ \mathcal{C}_ {\mu} = i[\mathfrak{n},\partial_ {\mu} \mathfrak{n}] . }\] <p>This is a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued quantity, in terms of components in basis $T^{a}$ it can be written as</p> \[\boxed{ \mathcal{C}_ {\mu} = -\hat{n} \times (\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}) \text{ in }\mathfrak{g} . }\] <p>The trivial part of the solution that is proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$, call it $\mathcal{A}$, is given by</p> \[\boxed{ \mathcal{A}_ {\mu} = a_ {\mu} \mathfrak{n},\quad a_ {\mu}\in \mathbb{R}. }\] <p>Put together, the total solution $\hat{A}$ is called the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">restricted gauge field</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">restricted gauge potential</code>,</p> \[\hat{A}=\mathcal{A}+\mathcal{C}, \quad \mathcal{A}\propto \mathfrak{n}\text{ and }\mathcal{C}=i[\mathfrak{n},\partial \mathfrak{n}],\] <p>where we have omitted the spacetime index $\mu$, which can be put back whenever needed.</p> <p>Recall that if we want to convert to the other convention, we need to substitute $A\to gA$. Thus our solutions in the conventional notation reads is $g\hat{A} =g \mathcal{A} +\mathcal{C}$, then $A = \mathcal{A} + \frac{1}{g} \mathcal{C}$. <strong>That’s why in the paper the solution $\mathcal{C}=\frac{i}{g}[\mathfrak{n},\partial \mathfrak{n}]$.</strong></p> <p>If the symmetry is broken to the subgroup $N$ induced by $\mathfrak{n}$, then $\mathcal{A}$ corresponds to the massless $U(1)$ component that can propagate for long distance. Geometrically, $\hat{A}$ is the component of the connection that leaves $\mathfrak{n}$ invariant during parallel transport.</p> <hr/> <p>Next we carry on to study the field strength $\hat{F}$ corresponding to the restricted field $\hat{A}$. We can see that $\hat{F}$ is proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$, since from $D_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}=0$ we have</p> \[[\hat{D}_ {\mu},\hat{D}_ {\nu}]\mathfrak{n} =-i[\hat{F}_ {\mu \nu},\mathfrak{n} ]=0,\] <p>where $\hat{D}_ {\mu}$ is the covariant derivative with respect to $\hat{A}$, $\hat{D}=\partial-i[\hat{A},-]$. This means that $\hat{F}$ must be proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$.</p> <p>The following identities might be helpful (For $SU(2)$):</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathfrak{n} \mathfrak{n} = \hat{n}^{a}\hat{n}^{b}\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{a} \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{b} &amp;= \frac{1}{4}\mathbb{1}_ {2}, \\ [\mathfrak{n} ,[\mathfrak{n} ,\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} ]] &amp;= \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}, \\ [[\mathfrak{n},\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} ],[\mathfrak{n} ,\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} ]] &amp;= - \partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} . \end{align*}\] <p>We have</p> \[\begin{align*} \hat{F}:= &amp; \partial_ {\mu}\hat{A}_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}\hat{A}_ {\mu}-i[\hat{A}_ {\mu},\hat{A}_ {\nu}]\\ =&amp; (\partial_ {\mu}a_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}a_ {\mu})\mathfrak{n} +i[\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} ,\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} ]\\ =&amp;: f_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} +H_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} . \end{align*}\] <p>It is not obvious that $[\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n},\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n}]$ is proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$. But after some derivation we find</p> \[[\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n},\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n}] = -(\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n})^{a}(\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n})^{b}\epsilon^{abc}T^{c},\] <p>which in $\mathfrak{g}$ is just $-(\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n})\times(\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n})$. Since $\partial \hat{n}$ is orthogonal to $\hat{n}$, their cross product is aligned with $\hat{n}$. So indeed $\hat{F}$ is aligned with $\mathfrak{n}$.</p> <p>$H_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n}$ is in matrix form, if we want to “project out” the components $H_ {\mu \nu}$, we can write</p> \[H_ {\mu \nu} \mathfrak{n} = \partial_ {\mu} (i\mathfrak{n} \partial_ {\nu} \mathfrak{n}) -(\mu \leftrightarrow \nu),\] <p>This form is similar to $F_ {\mu \nu}=\partial_ {\mu}A_ {\mu}-(\mu\leftrightarrow \nu)$. In fact, in the case of $SU(2)$, we can simplify it further to give an explicit expression for $H_ {\mu \nu}$ (without $\mathfrak{n}$). The final expression will be in terms of $\hat{n}_ {1,2}$. Recall that $\hat{n}_ {1}, \hat{n}_ {2}, \hat{n}$ form a right-handed orthogonal basis, let $\mathfrak{n}_ {1,2}$ be the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued counterparts of $\hat{n}_ {1,2}$. It is easily verified that</p> \[[\mathfrak{n}_ {i},\mathfrak{n} _ {j}] = i\epsilon^{ijk}\mathfrak{n}_ {k} .\] <p>Since $\partial \hat{n}$ is perpendicular to $\hat{n}$ (since $\hat{n}$ has fixed length), $\partial \hat{n}=(\cdots)\hat{n}_ {1}+(\cdots)\hat{n}_ {2}$. In $\mathfrak{g}$-space we have the same. Write</p> \[\begin{align*} \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} =&amp; k_ {1}\mathfrak{n} _ {1}+k_ {2}\mathfrak{n} _ {2}, \\ \partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} =&amp; k'_ {1}\mathfrak{n} _ {1}+k'_ {2}\mathfrak{n} _ {2}, \end{align*}\] <p>then</p> \[H_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} = (k_ {2}k_ {1}'-k_ {1}k_ {2}')\mathfrak{n},\] <p>where $k_ {1}k_ {2}’$ is actually the $\mu \longleftrightarrow\nu$ replaced $k_ {2}k_ {1}’$. What are the $k$’s? Well, we can project them from $\partial \mathfrak{n}$, giving</p> \[\begin{align*} k_ {1} =&amp; \hat{n}_ {1} \cdot (\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}) = \hat{n}_ {1}\cdot(\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {1}\times \hat{n}_ {2}), \\ k_ {2} =&amp; \hat{n}_ {2}\cdot(\partial_ {\mu} \hat{n}) = \hat{n}_ {2}\cdot(\hat{n}_ {1}\times \partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {2}). \end{align*}\] <p>I hope the casual jumping between $\hat{n}$ and $\mathfrak{n}$ will not dissuade you from keep reading the note. The expression for $k’$ is just that of $k$ but with $\mu$ and $\nu$ interchanged. Then,</p> \[\begin{align*} k_ {2}k_ {1}' =&amp; \hat{n}_ {2}\cdot( \partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}) \; \hat{n}_ {1}\cdot(\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n})\\ =&amp; (\partial_ {\mu }\hat{n}_ {2})\cdot \hat{n} \; (\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1})\cdot \hat{n}, \end{align*}\] <p>in the last line we have exploited the fact that $\hat{n}_ {1,2}$ and $\hat{n}$ are orthodox. Since $\hat{n}_ {2}$ has unit length, its derivative is orthodox to itself,</p> \[\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {2} = (\cdots) \hat{n}_ {1} + (\cdots)\hat{n}.\] <p>Similarly for $\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1}$. Then, since $\hat{n}_ {1}$ is orthodox to $\hat{n}_ {2}$, we have</p> \[\begin{align*} k_ {2}k_ {1}'=&amp; (\partial_ {\mu }\hat{n}_ {2})\cdot \hat{n} \; (\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1})\cdot \hat{n}\\ =&amp; (\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {2})\cdot(\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1}). \end{align*}\] <p>As a result,</p> \[\begin{align*} H_ {\mu \nu} &amp;= (\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {2})\cdot(\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1}) - (\mu \leftrightarrow \nu) \\ &amp;= \partial_ {\mu} (\hat{n}_ {2}\cdot\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}_ {1}) - (\mu\leftrightarrow \nu)\\ &amp;=: \partial_ {\mu} C_ {\nu} - \partial_ {\nu} C_ {\mu}. \end{align*}\] <p>In summary, we have</p> \[\begin{align*} \hat{F} &amp;= f_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} +H_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} ,\\ f_ {\mu \nu} &amp;= \partial_ {\mu}a_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}a_ {\mu},\\ H_ {\mu \nu} \mathfrak{n} &amp;=i[\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} ,\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} ],\\ H_ {\mu \nu} &amp;= \partial_ {\mu}C_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}C_ {\mu}, \; C_ {\mu}:= \hat{n}_ {2}\cdot \partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}_ {1}. \end{align*}\] <hr/> <p>We have talked about the monopole-like background $\mathcal{C}$ and the free, massless $U(1)$ field $\mathcal{A}$. The rest of the total $SU(N)$ gauge field can be symbolically denoted as $X$, thus we can separate the total gauge field $A$ into the following three parts,</p> \[A = \mathcal{A}+\mathcal{C}+X, \quad [X,\mathfrak{n} ]\neq0\] <p>where</p> <ul> <li>$A$ is the entire $SU(N)$ field.

Possible singularity points are allowed. It can not fluctuated and has no dynamics.</li> <li>$X$ is the rest of $A$. I’d like to think of it as the non-abelian fluctuation about the background $\mathcal{C}$, but of course this is only a perturbative perspective.</li> </ul> <p>Using the formula</p> \[a\times b\times c=b(a\cdot c) - a(c \cdot b),\] <p>we have</p> \[\vec{X} = \hat{n} \times D_ {\mu} \hat{n}, \quad D = \partial - i[A,-].\] <hr/> <p>We emphasize that $\hat{n}$ may not be globally defined. Let $\hat{n}_ {\infty}$ be the asymptotic field configuration at the spatial boundary $\partial\mathbb{R}^{3}=\mathbb{S}^{2}$. Since $\hat{n}$ takes value in all unit-norm vectors in all directions, the collection of all $\hat{n}$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^{2}$, think of it as the set of the end points of all possible $\hat{n}$. Thus,</p> \[\hat{n}_ {\infty}: \mathbb{S}^{2} \to \mathbb{S}^{2}.\] <p>If the winding number of $\hat{n}_ {\infty}$ is nonzero, then it can not be continuously deformed into a unit map. Then $\hat{n}$ can not be well-defined everywhere, there must be at least one singularity, where the direction of $\hat{n}$ is not defined. If $\hat{n}$ were a scalar field, we usually let it go to zero to avoid this problem, like with vortices.</p> <h2 id="gauge-transformation">Gauge transformation</h2> <p>If we fix the $\mathfrak{n}(x)$ field, then gauge group is broken to $SU(2)\to U(1)$, where $U(1)$ is the little group of $\mathfrak{n}(x)$, which depends on the position $x$. The unbroken $U(1)$ symmetry corresponds to the massless “photon” that survives at long distance. What if we do not fix $\mathfrak{n}(x)$, and allow it to gauge-transform freely? Then, under gauge transformation $\mathfrak{n}$ will rotate in a $x$-dependent way.</p> <p>To keep our notation in agree with others, let’s denote the gauge transformation as $\Omega=e^{ i\alpha }$, where $\alpha=\alpha^{a}T^{a}$ is a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued <strong>infinitesimal</strong> vector. The gauge field $A$ transforms as</p> \[A \to A+ D\alpha,\quad D_ {\mu}=\partial_ {\mu}-i[A_ {\mu},-].\] <p>What about $\mathfrak{n}=\hat{n}^{a}T^{a}$? This $\mathfrak{g}$-valued field is not a part of the Lagrangian so it is not obvious how it should transform under gauge transform, or if it should transform at all. For example at the beginning I thought that since $\hat{n}$ is a vector in physical space, why should it be affected by gauge transformation? Then again, since $\mathfrak{n}$ plays a similar rule to the Higgs boson, maybe it should transform as a adjoint scalar. That is what was adopted by Cho and other people, so I’ll stick to it.</p> <p>The Higgs-like field $\mathfrak{n}$ transforms under an infinitesimal gauge transformation as</p> \[\mathfrak{n} \to \mathfrak{n} +i[\alpha,\mathfrak{n} ] = \mathfrak{n} -\vec{\alpha}\times \hat{n}{\Large\mid}_ {\mathfrak{g} }.\] <p>The notation $\vec{\alpha}\times \hat{n}{\Large\mid}_ {\mathfrak{g}}$ means that $\vec{\alpha}\times \hat{n}$ is a vector in Lie algebra.</p> <hr/> <p>The background $\mathcal{C}$ together with $\mathcal{A}$ constitute the so-called restricted gauge field $\hat{A}$ that is bonded to the adjoint field $\mathfrak{n}$, in the sense that $\hat{A}$ is given by the solution of $D\mathfrak{n}=0$. After a gauge transformation, $\mathfrak{n}\to\mathfrak{n}’$ and $\hat{A}\to\hat{A}’$, but we would like the equation to hold independently of the gauge transformation, that is, after an arbitrary gauge transformation we want</p> \[D'\mathfrak{n} ' := (\partial-i[\hat{A}',-])\,\mathfrak{n}' =\partial \mathfrak{n}' -i[\hat{A}',\mathfrak{n}' ]=0.\] <p>This is guaranteed if we set $\hat{A}$ to transform as a regular gauge field</p> \[\hat{A}\to \hat{A}'=\Omega(\hat{A}+i\partial)\Omega ^{\dagger}.\] <p>while let $\mathfrak{n}$ transform as a adjoint scalar, \(\mathfrak{n} =\to \mathfrak{n'=\Omega \mathfrak{n} } \Omega ^{\dagger}.\) Now, as we wanted, $\hat{A}$ is the solution to $\mathcal{D}_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}=0$ in a <strong>gauge independent</strong> way: If $\hat{A}$ is a solution, after gauge transform, the transformed field $\hat{A}’$ is still a solution to $D’_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}’=0$.</p> <p>After a gauge transformation we would like</p> \[\hat{A}' = \mathcal{A}' + \mathcal{C}'.\] <p>Let’s focus on $\mathcal{A}$ first. It is the $\mathfrak{n}$-direction projection of $\hat{A}$, that is</p> \[\mathcal{A}=a\mathfrak{n} , \quad \mathcal{A} = 2\mathrm{Tr}\,(\mathfrak{n} \hat{A}) \equiv \hat{n} \cdot \hat{A},\] <p>the factor of $2$ is due to the normalization $\mathrm{Tr}\,T^{a}T^{b}=\frac{1}{2}\delta^{ab}$. <strong>This should be treated as the definition of $\mathcal{a}$, and this definition better be gauge independent</strong>, hence after gauge transformation we want</p> \[\mathcal{a}'=2\mathrm{Tr}\,(\mathfrak{n} '\hat{A}').\] <p>This will fix the gauge transformation for $\mathcal{A}$. We have</p> \[a' = a + 2i\mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace \mathfrak{n} \partial U^{\dagger}U \right\rbrace .\] <p>Let the gauge transformation be given by $\Omega=e^{ i\alpha }$ where $\alpha=\alpha^{a}T^{a}$, then the infinitesimal form reads</p> \[a \to \mathcal{A}' = a+2\mathrm{Tr}\,(\mathfrak{n}\partial \alpha )\equiv a+\hat{n}\cdot \partial \vec{\alpha}.\] <p>Note that it is no longer a total derivative, but the projection of a total derivative in $\hat{n}$ direction.</p> <p>Note that this is not simply</p> \[\mathcal{A}\to \Omega \mathcal{A}\Omega ^{\dagger},\quad \mathcal{C}\to \Omega(\mathcal{C}+i\partial)\Omega ^{\dagger}.\] <p>To determine the gauge transform of $\mathcal{C}$, start from the definition:</p> \[\mathcal{C} = i[\mathfrak{n} ,\partial \mathfrak{n} ] = 2i\mathfrak{n} \partial \mathfrak{n}.\] <p>Under a gauge transform, $\mathfrak{n}\to \mathfrak{n}’=\Omega \mathfrak{n}\Omega ^{\dagger}$, consequently the transform of $\mathcal{C}$ in terms of $\mathfrak{n}$ should be</p> \[\mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{C}'=2i \mathfrak{n}' \partial (\mathfrak{n}') = 2i\Omega \mathfrak{n} \Omega ^{\dagger}\partial(\Omega \mathfrak{n} \Omega ^{\dagger}).\] <p>Note that the right-hand-side of the above equation is only equal to $\Omega(\mathcal{C}+i\partial)\Omega ^{\dagger}$ when they are both under a trace, otherwise they are not equal to each other.</p> <p>Regarding $X$ in $A = \mathcal{A}+\mathcal{C}+X$. $X$ also transforms as a adjoint scalar,</p> \[X\to \Omega X \Omega ^{\dagger}.\] <p>How the field transforms tells us what gauge invariant terms we could construct to be included into the Lagrangian. We know that $\left\lvert D_ {\mu}\mathcal{A} \right\rvert^{2}$ and $\left\lvert D_ {\mu}X \right\rvert^{2}$ are gauge invariant, so they should appear in the Lagrangian. Next, let’s go to the details.</p> <hr/> <p>Another possible gauge symmetry reads (in Cho’s notation)</p> \[\begin{align*} \delta \hat{n} &amp;=0, \quad \delta A_ {\mu} = \frac{1}{g} \hat{n}\cdot D_ {\mu}\vec{\alpha},\\ \delta \hat{A}_ {\mu} &amp;= \frac{1}{g}(\hat{n}\cdot D_ {\mu}\hat{\alpha})\hat{n},\\ \delta \vec{X}_ {\mu} &amp;= \frac{1}{g}[D_ {\mu}\vec{\alpha}-(\hat{n}\cdot D_ {\mu} \vec{\alpha})\hat{n}], \end{align*}\] <p>where $A_ {\mu}:=\hat{n}\cdot \vec{A}_ {\mu}$.</p> <p>In general,given an arbitrary $\hat{n}$, there exists different decomposition of gauge transformation that preserves the defining equation $D\mathfrak{n}=0$ besides the standard one. In other words, once $\hat{n}$ is given there are various possibles ways to define the gauge transformation of $\hat{A}$ that preserves the defining condition.</p> <hr/> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">generalized Lorentz gauge</code> condition is defined to be</p> \[\partial_ {\mu}\hat{A}_ {\mu}=0,\] <p>substitute the definition $\hat{A}=\mathcal{A}+\mathcal{C}$, for $\mathfrak{n}$-direction components and perpendicular to $\mathfrak{n}$ direction we have</p> \[\begin{align*} (\partial_ {\mu} a_ {\mu} )\mathfrak{n} =&amp; 0 , \\ a_ {\mu} \partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} +i[\mathfrak{n} ,\partial^{2}\mathfrak{n} ]=&amp;0. \end{align*}\] <h2 id="lagrangian-of-restricted-and-extended-qcd">Lagrangian of Restricted and Extended QCD</h2> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">restricted QCD</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RCD</code> for short, is the self-energy of restricted gauge field $\hat{A}$,</p> \[\mathcal{L}_ {\text{RCD}} = - \frac{1}{2g^{2}} \mathrm{Tr}\,\hat{F}_ {\mu \nu}^{2}.\] <p>Substitute in</p> \[\begin{align*} \hat{F} &amp;= f_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} +H_ {\mu \nu}\mathfrak{n} ,\\ f_ {\mu \nu} &amp;= \partial_ {\mu}a_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}a_ {\mu},\\ H_ {\mu \nu} \mathfrak{n} &amp;=i[\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} ,\partial_ {\nu}\mathfrak{n} ]. \end{align*}\] <p>we have</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathcal{L}_ {\text{RCD}} =&amp; - \frac{1}{4g^{2}}f_ {\mu \nu}^{2} - \frac{1}{2g^{2}}\mathrm{Tr}\,H^{2}-\frac{1}{g^{2}}\mathrm{Tr}\,f_ {\mu \nu}H^{\mu \nu}\\ =&amp; - \frac{1}{4g^{2}} (\partial_ {\mu}a_ {\nu}-\partial_ {\nu}a_ {\mu})^{2}\\ &amp; - \frac{1}{4g^{2}}(\partial_ {\mu}\hat{n}^{a}\partial_ {\nu}\hat{n}^{b}-(a\leftrightarrow b))^{2}\\ &amp;+ \frac{1}{2g^{2}} \epsilon^{abc}f_ {\mu \nu}\hat{n}^{a}\partial^{\mu}\hat{n}^{b}\partial^{\nu}\hat{n}^{c} \end{align*}.\] <p>OK, now let’s include final piece, the non-abelian fluctuation $X$.

However it is just the gauge part, and it is just the same QCD Lagrangian, separated into different components. To simplify the extended QCD Lagrangian, recall that $\mathfrak{n}$ is orthogonal to $X$ by construction, namely $\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathfrak{n}X_ {\mu}=0$ for all $\mu$, then we have</p> \[\partial \mathrm{Tr}\,\mathfrak{n} X=0=\mathrm{Tr}\,(\partial \mathfrak{n} X+\mathfrak{n} \partial X)\implies \mathrm{Tr}\,\partial \mathfrak{n} X=-\mathrm{Tr}\,\mathfrak{n}\partial X.\] <p>Note that this “exchange the derivative and change the sign” operation is only valid under the trace.</p> <p>Also take into consideration the cyclic property of trace, we can simplify the following term:</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace \hat{F}_ {\mu \nu} \hat{D}_ {\mu}X_ {\nu} \right\rbrace =&amp; (f_ {\mu \nu}+H_ {\mu \nu}) \mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace \mathfrak{n}(\partial_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}-i[\hat{A}_ {\mu},X_ {\nu}]) \right\rbrace \\ =&amp; (f_ {\mu \nu}+H_ {\mu \nu}) \mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace \mathfrak{n} \partial_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}-\mathfrak{n} i(\hat{A}_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}-X_ {\nu}\hat{A}_ {\mu}) \right\rbrace \\ =&amp; (f_ {\mu \nu}+H_ {\mu \nu})\mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace -\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n}X_ {\nu} -i\mathfrak{n} \hat{A}_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}+i\mathfrak{n} X_ {\nu}\hat{A}_ {\mu} \right\rbrace \\ =&amp; (f_ {\mu \nu}+H_ {\mu \nu})\mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace -(\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} X_ {\nu} -i\hat{A}_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} X_ {\nu}+i\mathfrak{n} \hat{A}_ {\mu}X_ {\nu})\right\rbrace \\ =&amp; (f_ {\mu \nu}+H_ {\mu \nu})\mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace -(\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} -i(\hat{A}_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} -\mathfrak{n} \hat{A}_ {\mu})X_ {\nu}) \right\rbrace \\ =&amp; (f_ {\mu \nu}+H_ {\mu \nu})\mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace -(\partial_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} -i[\hat{A}_ {\mu},\mathfrak{n} ])X_ {\nu} \right\rbrace \\ =&amp;(f_ {\mu \nu}+H_ {\mu \nu}) \mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace -(\hat{D}_ {\mu}\mathfrak{n} )X_ {\nu} \right\rbrace \\ =&amp;0. \end{align*}\] <p>This holds for not only $\hat{F}$ but really anything that is proportional to $\mathfrak{n}$, which certainly includes the term proportional to $\mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace [X_ {\mu},X_ {\nu}]\hat{D}X \right\rbrace$.</p> <p>With this great simplification, the extended Lagrangian reads</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathcal{L}_ {\text{ECD}} =&amp; - \frac{1}{2g^{2}}\mathrm{Tr}\,F^{2} \\ =&amp; - \frac{1}{2g^{2}}\mathrm{Tr}\,\left\lbrace \hat{F}^{2}-2i\hat{F}_ {\mu \nu}[X_ {\mu},X_ {\nu}]+(\hat{D}_ {\mu}X_ {\nu}-\hat{D}_ {\nu}X_ {\mu})^{2} - [X_ {\mu},X_ {\nu}]^{2}\ \right\rbrace. \end{align*}\] <p>In $SU(2)$, the Lie-algebra space is a three dimensional vector space, since $X_ {\mu}$ is orthogonal to $\hat{n}$, $X_ {\mu}\times X_ {\nu}$ is aligned with $\hat{n}$. In terms of matrices, $[X_ {\mu},X_ {\nu}]\propto \mathfrak{n}$.

This is to be interpreted as $\frac{1}{0^{\left\lvert \alpha \right\rvert}}=\frac{1}{0 }\approx \infty$. The purpose of this particular definition is to make sure that $\exp_ {q}$ has the same asymptotic behavior as the regular exponential function.</p> <p>As you can check, at the limit $q\to 1$ they regress to normal log and exp functions.</p> <p>For computational convenience, we will stick with the <strong>q-sigmoid of the first kind</strong>, which is the direct deformation of the regular sigmoid function</p> \[\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{ -z }}.\] <p>As a result we have the $q$-sigmoid of the first kind:</p> \[\boxed{ \sigma_ {q}(z) := \frac{1}{1+\exp_ {q}(-z)}. }\] \[\frac{ \partial \sigma_ {q}(z) }{ \partial z } = \beta(q,z)\sigma_ {q}(z)(1-\sigma_ {q}(z))\] <p>where</p> \[\beta(q,z) = \frac{1}{1-z(1-q)}.\] <p>This should be compared to the case of regular sigmoid function:</p> <p>\(\frac{ \partial \sigma(z) }{ \partial z } = \sigma(z) (1-\sigma(z)).\) The cross entropy loss function now reads</p> \[\boxed{ L= - \sum_ {i=1}^{n}[y_ {i}\ln(\sigma _ {q_ {i} }(z_ {i} ))+(1-y_ {i})\ln(1-\sigma_ {q_ {i} }(z_ {i} ))]. }\] <p>where $z_ {i}=\theta\cdot X^{(i)}$, $X^{(i)}$ the $i$-th observed data and the q-parameters $q_ {i}$ are different for each sample. Someone write it as $z_ {i}=\theta^{T}X^{(i)}$, but I neglect the transpose symbol since now both $\theta$ and $X$ are understood as vectors. For starters we can set all the $q_ {i}$ as the same constant for all samples, do a grid search over certain intervals, such as from 0 to 10 or something. This will greatly reduce the number of free parameters hence prevents over fitting.</p> <p>We will use the gradient method to find the optimal values of parameters that minimized the loss function.

This means that the interaction doesn’t turn off in the far past and far future. The standard lore is to insert an adiabatic switching function $f(t)$,</p> \[H_ {I}(t) = g \int d^{3}x \, \phi(x) \rho(\vec{x})\to f(t) H_ {I}.\] <p>$\phi$ is in the interaction picture, which means that it is the free field. $f(t) =1$ for $-T / 2\leq t\leq T /2$, and $f(t)=0$ for $T&lt; - T /2-\Delta$ and $T &gt; T / 2+\Delta$. It goes to zero during a time interval $\Delta$ smoothly (adiabatically).</p> <p>To make sure that</p> \[\lim_ { T \to \infty } \left\langle 0 \right\rvert U\left( T/2, - T/2 \right) \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle=1,\] <p>counter terms are needed.</p> <p>First, some clarifications on notations. $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle$ is the free vacuum that is annihilated by the free Hamiltonian, $\left\lvert 0_ {P} \right\rangle$ or $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle_ {P}$ is the physical vacuum which is an eigenstate of the full Hamiltonian $H$ without the adiabatic function,</p> \[H \left\lvert 0_ {P} \right\rangle = E_ {0} \left\lvert 0_ {P} \right\rangle,\] <p>where $E_ {0}$ is the physical ground energy.</p> <p>The argument given by Coleman is that, in the far past, when $t &lt; -T / 2-\Delta$, $f(t)=0$ and the ground state is $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle$, the free ground state or bare ground state. As time goes from $-T / 2-\Delta$ to $-T /2$, we adiabatically turn on the interaction, by the adiabatic theorem, we expect $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle$ to smoothly go to $\left\lvert 0_ {P} \right\rangle$, perhaps up to some phases.</p> <p>The extra phase can be eliminated by a counter term, $H_ {I} \to H_ {I} +a$. The counter term also makes the interacting ground state energy to be zero. Using Wick diagram (by Coleman’s definition, Feynman diagram is for computing the S-matrix, Wick diagram is for computing operators), it can be shown that $\left\langle 0 \right\rvert S\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle=0$. The classic source we introduced at the beginning of the note can not produce any on-shell mesons since $\tilde{\rho}(p)=0$ for on-shell $p^{\mu}$. $\rho(\vec{x})$ can only transfer momentum, not energy.</p> <hr/> <p>The ground state is more interesting than the S-matrix. In the $T\to\infty$ limit, the ground state energy reads</p> \[E_ {0} = - \frac{g^{2}}{2} \int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}} \, \frac{\left\lvert \tilde{\rho}(\vec{p}) \right\rvert ^{2}}{\left\lvert \vec{p} \right\rvert^{2}+\mu^{2} }\] <p>where $\tilde{\rho}$ is the Fourier transformation of $\rho(\vec{x})$, the specific convention can be found in a different blog of mine.</p> <p>The minus sign means that, adding the interaction $g\rho \phi$ to the free Hamiltonian will decrease the energy. This is a general result, adding an extra term $V$ that has zero vev to the Hamiltonian $H_ {0}$ will always decrease the energy. That is because, let $\left\lvert E_ {0} \right\rangle$ be the ground state of $H_ {0}$, adding $V$ will make $\left\lvert E_ {0} \right\rangle$ a trial state, the new ground state will be something else $\left\lvert E_ {0}’ \right\rangle$. $E_ {0}’$ must be smaller than $E_ {0}$ otherwise it won’t be a ground state.</p> <p>Coleman also calculated the ground state wave function, an expansion of the physical vacuum $\left\lvert 0_ {P} \right\rangle$ in terms into the basis states $\left\lvert \vec{p}_ {1},\cdots,\vec{p}_ {n} \right\rangle$, eigenstates of the free Hamiltonian $H_ {0}$.

Also, if $\rho(\vec{x})=\delta(\vec{x})$, namely for point particles, then $\alpha$ blows up.

Introduce the normal ordering, the Hamiltonian is defined by</p> \[H = \int d^{3}x \, \mathcal{N}_ {a,\mu}\left\lbrace \frac{1}{2}\pi^{2}(\vec{x}) + \frac{1}{2}(\nabla \phi(\vec{x}))^{2} + \frac{\mu^{2}}{2} \phi^{2}(\vec{x}) + U(\phi) + g \rho(\vec{x})\phi(\vec{x})\right\rbrace ,\] <p>where $\mathcal{N}_ {a,\mu}$ is the normal ordering with respect to mass $\mu$ and annihilation operator $a_ {p}$, which expands the field operator in plane waves:</p> \[\begin{align*} \phi(\vec{x}) &amp;= \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega_ {p}}} \, (a_ {p} e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} }+\text{h.c.}), \\ \pi(\vec{x}) &amp;= \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \frac{\sqrt{\omega_ {p}}}{\sqrt{2}} \, (-i a_ {p} e^{i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} }+\text{h.c.}), \end{align*}\] <p>in our case $d=3$ and $\text{h.c.}$ stands for Hermitian conjugate.</p> <p>Recall that there are two “definitions” for vacuum state, 1) the zero-occupation state $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle$ in the Fock representation, namely the state that is annihilated by $a_ {p}$ for all $\vec{p}$; 2) the lowest energy state $\left\lvert \Omega \right\rangle$, which is the lowest energy state of the total Hamiltonian. When these two descriptions do not coincide, we say the vacuum is polarized. The energy difference is sometimes called the vacuum polarization energy.</p> <p>We have Ignored the counter terms. The free Hamiltonian reads</p> \[H_ {0} = \int d^{d}x \, \mathcal{N}_ {a} \left\lbrace \mathcal{H}_ {0} \right\rbrace ,\quad \mathcal{H}_ {0} = \frac{1}{2}\pi^{2}(\vec{x}) + \frac{1}{2}(\nabla \phi)^{2} + \frac{\mu^{2}}{2} \phi^{2}.\] <p>Expanding the fields into normal modes, after some manipulation we have</p> \[H_ {0}= \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \omega_ {p} a_ {p} ^{\dagger} a_ {p} .\] <p>In other words, $H_ {0}$ is diagonalized by $a$ and $a^{\dagger}$, so there is no vacuum polarization.</p> <p>Include the source term, we have</p> \[H = \int d^{d}x \, \mathcal{N}_ {a} \left\lbrace \mathcal{H} \right\rbrace ,\quad \mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2}\pi^{2}(\vec{x}) + \frac{1}{2}(\nabla \phi)^{2} + \frac{\mu^{2}}{2} \phi^{2}+g\rho\phi.\] <p>The source $\rho(\vec{x})$ has Fourier transform</p> \[\rho(\vec{x}) = \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \tilde{\rho}(\vec{p}) e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} },\quad \tilde{\rho}(\vec{p})= (j_ {p} +j^\ast _ {-p}) .\] <p>Note that $j_ {p}$ and $j_ {p}^\ast$ are c-number coefficients, since $\rho$ is assumed to be a classical source. In this decomposition it is not mandatory that $j_ {p}^\ast=j_ {-p}$, but we could always shift them so that this relation is satisfied. To see it, notice that since $\rho$ is real, we have $\tilde{\rho}(\vec{p})=\tilde{\rho}^\ast(-\vec{p})$, which implies that the combined value of $j_ {p}+j^\ast_ {-p}$ satisfy the relation that under $p\leftrightarrow-p$ it requires a complex conjugate. This condition is trivially satisfied no matter if $j_ {p}=j_ {-p}^\ast$ or not. Assume they don’t satisfy the condition $j^\ast_ {p} = j_ {-p}$, but $j^\ast_ {p}-j_ {-p}=2z_ {p}$ instead, where $z_ {p}\in\mathbb{C}$. We can redefine $j’_ {p}= j_ {p}-z_ {p}$, $j_ {-p}^{‘\ast} = j_ {-p}^{\ast}+z_ {p}$ so that $j’_ {p}=j^{‘\ast}_ {-p}$. Without loss of generality, we can always assume that the above relation is satisfied. In the following we will assume that $j_ {p}=j^\ast_ {-p}$.</p> <p>The source term reads</p> \[\int d^{d}x \, (g\rho\phi)= g\int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega _ {p}}}\, ( a_ {p} \tilde{\rho}(\vec{p})^\ast + a_ {p} ^{\dagger} \tilde{\rho}(\vec{p}) ).\] <p>The Hamiltonian with a source now has extra terms involving $\tilde{\rho}(\vec{p})$. It can be diagonalized by completing the squares, we get</p> \[H = \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \left\lbrace \omega _ {p} \tilde{a}_ {p} ^{\dagger}\tilde{a}_ {p} - \frac{g^{2}}{2\omega _ {p} ^{2}} \left\lvert \tilde{\rho}(\vec{p}) \right\rvert ^{2} \right\rbrace\] <p>where</p> \[\tilde{a}_ {p} := a_ {p} + \frac{g}{\omega _ {p} \sqrt{2\omega _ {p} }}\tilde{\rho}(\vec{p}).\] <p>The minus sign of the second term in the above-above equation agrees with the fact the the introduced source term should decrease the energy. $\tilde{a}_ {p}$ is the “free” annihilation operator shifted by a c-number. A shift in c-number would not affect the commutation relation, hence $\tilde{a}$ also satisfies the equal-time canonical commutation relation. The energy of the new ground state with source is</p> \[E_ {0}= - \frac{g^{2}}{2} \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \frac{1}{\omega _ {p} ^{2}} \left\lvert \tilde{\rho}(\vec{p}) \right\rvert ^{2},\] <p>Exactly in agreement with Coleman’s result, which is well defined as long as the integral over $\tilde{\rho}$ squared is finite, otherwise we need to introduce an counterterm to cancel the divergence. Which is not mentioned by Coleman at all is that, now the Hilbert space should be chosen as the Fock representation corresponding to $\tilde{a}_ {p}$, for example the ground state $\left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle$ at the presence of a source term is no longer that annihilated by $a_ {p}$ for all $p$, but rather $\tilde{a}_ {p}$ for all $p$:</p> \[\tilde{a}_ {p} \left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle =0 \quad \forall\; p.\] <p>Since</p> \[\tilde{a}_ {p} \left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle = 0=\left( a_ {p} + \frac{g}{\omega _ {p} \sqrt{2\omega _ {p} }}\tilde{\rho}(\vec{p}) \right) \left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle \implies \boxed{ a_ {p} \left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle = -\frac{g}{\omega _ {p} \sqrt{2\omega _ {p} }}\tilde{\rho}(\vec{p}) \left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle},\] <p>$\left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle$ is a <em>coherent state</em> from the perspective of the original annihilation operator $a$’s, it is sometimes called a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fock coherent state</code>.</p> <hr/> <p>How can $\left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle$ be constructed from $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle$ via <em>displacement</em> operation? First we need to define the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smeared ladder operator</code> $a(f)$ where $f\in L^{2}(\mathcal{D})$ on some measurable domain $\mathcal{D}$. As usual, the Fourier expansion of $f(\vec{x})$ reads</p> \[f(\vec{x}) = \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}}\, \tilde{f}(\vec{p})e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} },\] <p>note that in the plane wave expansion of fields there is a factor of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\omega _ {p} }}$, however it doesn’t make any sense to include that factor in the expansion of $f(\vec{x})$, since $f$ is just a function, why should we introduce a mas parameter $m$ in the first place? Without mass you can’t define $\omega _ {p}$.</p> <p>Define the smeared ladder operators as (in agreement with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Franco Strocchi</code>)</p> \[\boxed{ \begin{align*} a^{\dagger}(f) :=&amp; \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \tilde{f}(\vec{p}) a^{\dagger}_ {p}, \\ a(f) :=&amp; \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \tilde{f}(\vec{p}) a_ {p}. \end{align*} }\] <p>This smear happens in the momentum space. Caution, $a^{\dagger}(f)$ is <strong>not</strong> the Hermitian conjugate of $a(f)$, $a^{\dagger}(f) \neq (a(f))^{\dagger}$.</p> <p>The commutation relation:</p> \[\begin{align*} [a(f),a^{\dagger}(g)] =&amp; \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \tilde{f}(\vec{p}) \tilde{g}(\vec{p})=\int d^{d}x \, f(\vec{x})g(\vec{x}), \\ [a(f),(a(g))^{\dagger}] =&amp; \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \tilde{f}(\vec{p}) \tilde{g}(\vec{p})^\ast =\int d^{d}x \, f(\vec{x})g(\vec{x})^\ast , \end{align*}\] <p>particularly we have</p> \[\boxed{ [a(f),(a(f))^{\dagger}] = \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \left\lvert \tilde{f}(\vec{p}) \right\rvert ^{2}. }\] <p>Define the canonical momentum smeared against $f$ as</p> \[\pi(f) := \int d^{d}x \, \pi(\vec{x}) f(\vec{x}),\] <hr/> <p>By the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, we have</p> \[e^{ -a^{\dagger}(f) } a_ {p} e^{ a^{\dagger}(f) } = a_ {p} +\tilde{f}(\vec{p}),\] <p>thus the state $\exp (a^{\dagger}(f)) \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle$ has a peculiar property:</p> \[a_ {p} e^{ a^{\dagger}(f) }\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle = \tilde{f}(\vec{p}) e^{ a^{\dagger}(f) }\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle.\] <p>However, $e^{ a^{\dagger}(f) }$ is not a unitary operator, which means that when acting on a state it can change the norm of it. To make it a unitary operator while preserving the desired properties, we can define a new operator:</p> \[\mathcal{D}_ {f}:= e^{ -i\pi(f) },\quad \pi(f) = \int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}} \, \sqrt{\frac{\omega _ {p} }{2}} (-ia_ {p} \tilde{f}(\vec{p})^\ast +\text{h.c.}).\] <p>$\mathcal{D}_ {f}$ is a unitary operator that satisfies</p> \[\mathcal{D}_ {f}^{\dagger} a_ {p} \mathcal{D}_ {f} = a_ {p} +\sqrt{\frac{\omega _ {p} }{2}}\tilde{f}(\vec{p}).\] <p>Then maybe $\mathcal{D}_ {f}$ can be used to create $\left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle$ from $\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle$:</p> \[\left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle = \mathcal{D}_ {k(\vec{x})} \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle,\] <p>where</p> \[\tilde{k}(\vec{p})= \frac{g}{\omega _ {p} ^{2}}\tilde{\rho}(\vec{p}).\] <p>Looks like we can’t just insert the source function with coupling $g\rho$ into the displacement and hope it gives the correct ground state.</p> <hr/> <p>The Euclidean symmetry $E(\vec{a},R)$ is implemented by a unitary operator $U(\vec{a},R)$, where $\vec{a}$ is the translation vector and $R$ the rotation. Euclidean group is a semidirect product of translation $T(\vec{a})$ and rotation $R$, $E=T\rtimes R$. Let’s focus on the translation for now.</p> <p>Under translation the field operator transforms as $T(\vec{a})\phi(\vec{x})T^{-1}(\vec{a})=\phi(\vec{x}+\vec{a})$, hence the original ladder operator transforms as $T(\vec{a})a_ {p}T^{-1}(\vec{a})=a_ {p} e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{a} }$, i.e. $a_ {p}$ acquires a phase under translation. Similarly for $\tilde{\rho}(\vec{p})$.</p> <p>Since the source term explicitly breaks the Euclidean symmetry, a natural question is how does $T(\vec{a})$ affect $\left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle$? Does $\left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle$ just acquires a phase as well? Direct calculation shows that</p> \[T(\vec{a}) \left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle = e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{a} }\left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle.\] <hr/> <p>An important question is, can the polarized (or displaced) vacuum $\left\lvert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle$ be expanded in original Fock states? According to the calculation did by Coleman, the answer should be yes, let’s try to verify that. Starting from the simplest case, let’s try to calculate the superposition between vacuum states with and without source:</p> \[\begin{align*} \left\langle 0 \middle\vert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle =&amp; \left\langle 0 \right\rvert\exp \left\lbrace -i\pi(k) \right\rbrace \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle \\ =&amp; \left\langle 0 \right\rvert \exp \left\lbrace K - K^{\dagger}\right\rbrace \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle \end{align*}\] <p>where</p> \[K :=- g\int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}} \, \frac{1}{\omega _ {p} \sqrt{2\omega _ {p} }} a_ {p} \tilde{p}(\vec{p})^\ast.\] <p>Using the BCH formula (provided $[X,Y]$ commutes with both $X$ and $Y$)</p> \[e^{ X+Y } = e^{ X }e^{ Y }e^{ -1/2 [X,Y]}\] <p>and</p> \[[K,K^{\dagger}] =g^{2} \int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}}\, \frac{1}{2\omega _ {p} ^{3}} \left\lvert \tilde{\rho}(\vec{p}) \right\rvert ^{2} =: \beta,\] <p>we have</p> \[\begin{align*} \left\langle 0 \middle\vert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle =&amp; \left\langle 0 \right\rvert\exp \left\lbrace -i\pi(k) \right\rbrace \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle \\ =&amp; \left\langle 0 \right\rvert \exp \left\lbrace K - K^{\dagger}\right\rbrace \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle \\ =&amp; \left\langle 0 \right\rvert \exp \left\lbrace -K^{\dagger}+K\right\rbrace \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle \\ =&amp; e^{ -\frac{1}{2} \beta }\left\langle 0 \right\rvert e^{ -K^{\dagger} } e^{ K } \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle \\ =&amp; e^{ -\frac{1}{2}\beta}. \end{align*}\] <p>It means that if $\tilde{\beta}(\vec{p})$ decreases fast enough, then $\beta$ is finite and so is the superposition between the two ground states! Otherwise, the superposition vanishes. <strong>The $g\to 0$ limit is well defined.</strong></p> <p>The above result can also be obtained via Wick’s theorem,</p> \[\text{string of }a,a^{\dagger} = \mathcal{N}_ {a}\left\lbrace \text{all possible contractions} \right\rbrace.\] <p>The vev is nonzero only for even $n$, with formula similar to</p> \[\left\langle 0 \right\rvert(a^{\dagger}(f)-a(f))^{n} \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle= [a(f),a(f)^{\dagger}] (n-1)!! = (n-1)!!

We have</p> \[\begin{align*} \left\langle \vec{p} \middle\vert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle =&amp; \left\langle 0 \right\rvert a_ {p} e^{ -i\pi(f) } \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle \\ =&amp; \left\langle 0 \right\rvert a_ {p}e^{-K^{\dagger}}e^{K} e^{-\beta/2} \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle \\ =&amp; \left\langle 0 \right\rvert ([a_ {p} ,e^{-K^{\dagger}}]+e^{K^{\dagger}}a_ {p}) e^{K} e^{-\beta/2}\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle\\ =&amp; \left\langle 0 \right\rvert [a_ {p} ,e^{-K^{\dagger}}] e^{K} e^{-\beta/2}\left\lvert 0 \right\rangle \end{align*}\] <p>We have</p> \[[a_ {p} ,e^{-K^{\dagger}}] = g \frac{\tilde{\rho}(\vec{p})}{\omega _ {p} \sqrt{2\omega _ {p} }}e^{-K^{\dagger}},\] <p>Hence</p> \[\left\langle \vec{p} \middle\vert 0_ {\rho} \right\rangle = ge^{-\beta/2} \frac{\tilde{\rho}(\vec{p})}{\omega _ {p} \sqrt{2\omega _ {p} }}\] <p>where</p> \[\beta = g^{2} \int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}}\, \frac{1}{2\omega _ {p} ^{3}} \left\lvert \tilde{\rho}(\vec{p}) \right\rvert ^{2}.\] <p>Which is in pretty good agreement of Coleman’s result up to a complex conjugation.</p> <h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1> <p>The canonical momentum in Schrodinger picture:</p> \[\pi(\vec{x}) = -\int \frac{d^{3}p}{(2\pi)^{3}} \, \sqrt{\frac{\omega _ {p} }{2}}(a_ {p}e^{ i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} } -a^{\dagger}_ {p} e^{ -i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} }) .\] <p>The CCR (canonical commutation relation) reads</p> \[\begin{align*} [a_ {k} ,a^{\dagger}_ {p} ] =&amp; (2\pi)^{3} \delta^{3}(\vec{k}-\vec{p}), \\ [\phi(\vec{x}),\pi(\vec{y},)] =&amp; i\delta^{3}(\vec{x}-\vec{y}). \end{align*}\] <p>The Parseval’s identity with our convention: for a real $L^{2}$ function $f(\vec{x})$,</p> \[\int d^{d}x \, f(\vec{x})^{2} = \int \frac{d^{d}p}{(2\pi)^{d}} \, \frac{2}{\omega _ {p} }\left\lvert f_ {p} \right\rvert ^{2}.\]]]></content><author><name>Baiyang Zhang</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coleman’s approach]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mathematical Note of Quantum Physics</title><link href="https://baiyangzhang.github.io/blog/2025/Mathematical-Note-of-Quantum-Physics/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mathematical Note of Quantum Physics"/><published>2025-09-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://baiyangzhang.github.io/blog/2025/Mathematical-Note-of-Quantum-Physics</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://baiyangzhang.github.io/blog/2025/Mathematical-Note-of-Quantum-Physics/"><![CDATA[<p>Let $T: \mathcal{H}\to\mathcal{H}’$ be a linear operator. $T$ is said to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bounded</code> if $\left\lVert T(\xi)\right\rVert\leq C\left\lVert \xi \right\rVert$ for all $\xi \in\mathcal{H}$ where $C&lt;\infty$.

His famous example, known as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cogito</code>, was ‘‘I think, therefore I am.’’</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Immanuel Kant defined in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The Critique of Pure Reason</code> (1781), of placing knowledge ‘‘on the secure path of a science.’’</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>These developments in philosophy reflected and reinforced the emergence of modern scientific consciousness.</p> </blockquote> <p>Such ideas, as necessary conditions for the development of natural science (not merely technology), seems to never had appeared in China. Year 1781 is the year 乾隆四十六年 in China, one of the most closed, ignorant, and autocratic era in history.</p> <blockquote> <p>During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the hallmark of scientific knowledge was indubitable certainty, ethics, political philosophy, and the human sciences were regarded as superior to the natural sciences. This view seems strange from the vantage point of the twenty-first century, when fields like physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology have all advanced with astonishing speed to discoveries that would have been unimaginable in the eighteenth century.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="the-workmanship-ideal-of-knowledge">The Workmanship Ideal of Knowledge</h2> <blockquote> <p>The first distinctive feature of the early Enlightenment concerns the range of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a priori knowledge</code>, the kind of knowledge that either follows from definitions or is otherwise deduced from covering principals. This is the kind of knowledge Descartes had in mind when he formulated his cogito and that Kant located in the realm of ‘‘analytic judgments.’</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Epistemology</strong> is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge. The term comes from the Greek words “episteme,” meaning knowledge or understanding, and “logos,” meaning study or discourse. Epistemology addresses questions such as:</p> <ul> <li>What is knowledge?</li> <li>How is knowledge acquired?</li> <li>What do people know?</li> <li>How do we know what we know?</li> <li>What are the limits of human knowledge?</li> <li>What makes beliefs justified or rational?</li> </ul> <p>In exploring these questions, epistemology deals with the definition of knowledge and its scope and limits. It often involves debating between different theories of knowledge, such as empiricism (the idea that knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience), rationalism (the idea that reason is the main source of knowledge), and constructivism (the idea that knowledge is constructed by individuals through their interactions with the world).</p> <p>Immanuel Kant distinguished between two types of judgments: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">analytic</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">synthetic</code>. These distinctions are central to his philosophy, especially in his work “Critique of Pure Reason.”</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Analytic Judgments</strong>: An analytic judgment is one where the predicate (the part of the sentence that says something about the subject) is contained within the subject itself. The truth of an analytic judgment is derived from the meanings of the words involved and logical reasoning. They are tautological in nature and do not add any new information about the world. For example, the statement “All bachelors are unmarried” is analytic because the predicate “unmarried” is part of the definition of the subject “bachelor.”</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Synthetic Judgments</strong>: A synthetic judgment, on the other hand, is one where the predicate adds something to the subject that is not contained within it. The truth of a synthetic judgment is determined through how our concepts relate to the world and cannot be known just by understanding the meanings of the words. They require empirical investigation or intuition. For instance, “The cat is on the mat” is a synthetic judgment because the concept of “the cat” does not inherently include the concept of “being on the mat.”</p> </li> </ol> <p>Kant’s distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments is fundamental to his epistemology, particularly in addressing the question of how human beings can have knowledge about the world. He further introduced the concept of “synthetic a priori” judgments, which are synthetic judgments that are known independently of experience (a priori), like mathematical truths.</p> <hr/> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">creationist</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">workmanship</code> theory in political science, often associated with the work of John Locke, is a theory of political obligation. It suggests that political authority and legitimacy derive from the consent of the governed, likening the role of the government or ruler to that of a craftsman or creator who constructs a system with the consent and for the benefit of the people.</p> <p>This theory is rooted in the idea that political and social structures are artificial constructs, made by human beings, unlike natural phenomena. The “creationist” aspect implies that political structures are deliberately created or constructed, rather than organically evolved. The “workmanship” aspect emphasizes the idea that the creators or rulers of these structures have a responsibility to the people they govern, similar to how a craftsman is responsible for the quality and function of their creation.</p> <p>Locke’s theory was revolutionary at its time because it challenged the prevailing notion of the divine right of kings, suggesting instead that political authority is justified only when it serves the interests of the governed and respects their rights. This theory laid the groundwork for modern concepts of democracy, individual rights, and the social contract.</p> <hr/> <p>Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, two prominent philosophers, had distinct views on natural law, reflecting their differing perspectives on human nature and the ideal structure of society.</p> <p>Hobbes, in his work “Leviathan,” presented a rather pessimistic view of human nature. He believed that in the state of nature (a hypothetical condition without government or laws), humans are driven by self-interest and a desire for self-preservation, leading to a “war of all against all” (bellum omnium contra omnes). In this state, life would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”</p> <p>For Hobbes, natural law is a set of precepts or general rules, <em>discovered by reason</em>, which prohibit anything destructive to one’s own life. <em>It’s based on the right of every individual to preserve their own life</em>, leading to the conclusion that humans should seek peace. This is where his famous concept of the social contract comes into play: individuals surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of a ruler (or a ruling assembly) to ensure their own safety and peace. Thus, Hobbes’s natural law is fundamentally about self-preservation and the avoidance of harm to others as a means of securing one’s own safety.</p> <p>Locke’s view, as articulated in “Two Treatises of Government,” is more optimistic about human nature. He believed that in the state of nature, humans live in a state of equality and freedom, not inherently prone to violence or war. For Locke, the <em>law of nature is a moral guide based on the belief that God has given the world to all people in common</em>. It teaches that, since all are equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in their life, health, liberty, or possessions.</p> <p>Locke’s natural law is grounded in the rights to life, liberty, and property. It includes the idea that people have the obligation to respect the rights of others. His social contract theory suggests that people form governments to protect these natural rights. If a government fails to do so, citizens have the right to overthrow it. This view laid the groundwork for modern democracy and significantly influenced the development of political philosophy in the Western world.</p> <p>So, Hobbes saw natural law as a means of avoiding the brutal state of nature through self-preservation and peace, whereas Locke viewed natural law as a moral guide ensuring equality and the inherent rights of life, liberty, and property.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>A basic issue for Locke and many of his contemporaries was the ontological status of natural law and in particular its relation to God’s will.</p> </blockquote> <p>In this sentence, “ontological status” refers to the fundamental nature or essence of natural law, especially in relation to its existence and its relationship to God’s will. Ontology, in philosophy, is the study of being or existence, and it deals with questions concerning what entities exist or can be said to exist, and how such entities can be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences.</p> <p>So, when discussing the “ontological status of natural law” in the context of John Locke and his contemporaries, the focus is on understanding the very essence of natural law: whether it exists as an objective reality independent of human beings, how it relates to or derives from God’s will, and what its fundamental characteristics are. This was a central topic in the philosophical and theological debates of that era, particularly in the context of determining the basis and legitimacy of moral and legal principles. Locke and many others were engaged in trying to understand whether natural laws were inherent aspects of the universe, ordained by God, or whether they were constructs of human reason and society.</p> <p>“Will-centered” refers to the philosophical position known as voluntarism. This is a theory that emphasizes the role of the will, either divine or human, in various philosophical contexts. In the context of Locke’s moral and political writings, being “will-centered” or a voluntarist means that Locke ultimately leaned towards the view that natural law and moral principles are determined by the will, particularly the will of God, rather than being inherent or objective truths that exist independently of any will.</p> <p>In Locke’s time, the debate about the nature of natural law often centered around whether natural laws were intrinsic to the universe (a position known as intellectualism or rationalism) or whether they were decrees of God’s will (voluntarism). A will-centered or voluntarist approach suggests that moral and legal norms derive their authority from an act of will, particularly the divine will, rather than from reason alone or from the inherent nature of reality. In this view, what is right or wrong, just or unjust, is so because God wills it to be that way, and human beings understand and follow these laws through revelation, religious teachings, or other means of discerning God’s will.</p> <blockquote> <p>Locke distinguished “ectype”’ from “archetype” ideas: ectypes are general ideas of substances, and archetypes are ideas constructed by man.</p> </blockquote> <p>John Locke’s distinction between “ectype” and “archetype” ideas is a crucial aspect of his epistemological theory, which he discusses in his work “An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.” This distinction is part of his broader inquiry into the nature of human knowledge and understanding.</p> <p>In Locke’s philosophy, archetypes are the original models or patterns from which copies are made. They are the fundamental, primary ideas that exist in the mind of God or, in a more secular interpretation, the perfect, abstract forms of things. When Locke refers to archetypes as ideas constructed by man, he means that these are the ideal standards or criteria we hold in our minds for categorizing and understanding the world. They represent our understanding of what the essential characteristics of a particular thing are.</p> <p>For instance, the archetype of a tree would be the idealized concept or mental representation of what a tree is supposed to be. This archetype is not derived from any particular tree but is a kind of composite or abstracted idea of “treeness” that we use to recognize and categorize individual trees.</p> <p>Ectypes, on the other hand, are derivative or secondary ideas. They are the imperfect copies or generalizations that we derive from our experience with individual instances in the world. Ectype ideas are more about the general ideas of substances we form based on our sensory experiences and observations. When we see many individual trees, for example, we form a general idea of what a tree is - this is an ectype. It’s a more practical, experiential idea based on the aggregation of real-world instances.</p> <p>In summary, Locke’s distinction between archetype and ectype ideas can be understood as a differentiation between the idealized, abstract concepts we hold in our minds as standards (archetypes) and the more practical, general ideas we form based on our sensory experience of the world (ectypes). Archetypes are about the essence or ideal form of things, while ectypes are about the general, often imperfect, concepts we derive from actual experiences.</p> <h2 id="the-preoccupation-with-certainty">The Preoccupation with Certainty</h2> <blockquote> <p>The post-Humean Enlightenment tradition has been marked by a fallibilist view of knowledge. All knowledge claims are fallible on this account, and science advances not by making knowledge more certain but by producing more knowledge. Recognizing the corrigibility of all knowledge claims and the possibility that one might always be wrong exemplifies the modern scientific attitude. As Karl Popper (1902-1994) noted, the most that we can say, when hypotheses survive empirical tests, is that they have not been falsified so that we can accept them provisionally.</p> </blockquote> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Value judgments</code> are statements or opinions that express an evaluation, typically of something’s worth, beauty, goodness, or morality. Examples include statements like “Lying is wrong,” or “This painting is beautiful.” A.J. Ayer was a key figure in the logical positivist movement, which held that for a statement to be meaningful, it must be either empirically verifiable (i.e., testable by observation or experiment) or analytically true (true by definition, like mathematical or logical statements). In logical positivism, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proposition</code> is a statement that can be either true or false. It’s a claim about the world that can, <em>at least in principle</em>, be tested and verified or falsified.</p> <p>The Logical Positivist movement, also known as Logical Empiricism, was a philosophical movement that emerged in the early 20th century. It primarily revolved around a group of philosophers associated with the Vienna Circle (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Moritz Schlick</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hans Hahn</code>, ), along with others like A.J. Ayer in Britain. This movement sought to apply the rigor of scientific methodology to philosophy, with a significant focus on the analysis of language and the verification of statements.</p> <p>Key Features of Logical Positivism include</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Verification Principle</strong>: The central tenet of Logical Positivism is the verification principle. This principle asserts that a statement is only meaningful if it can be empirically verified or is analytically true (true by virtue of its meaning, like “All bachelors are unmarried”). The idea was to eliminate metaphysical and abstract discussions that couldn’t be supported by empirical evidence or logical reasoning.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Empiricism and Science</strong>: Logical Positivists emphasized the importance of empirical evidence and scientific methods in acquiring knowledge. They viewed science as the model for all true knowledge.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rejection of Metaphysics</strong>: They were critical of metaphysics and other traditional philosophical endeavors, which they saw as meaningless since such statements couldn’t be empirically verified. They believed that many philosophical problems arose from misunderstandings of language and could be resolved by clarifying the language used.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Language and Meaning</strong>: A significant focus was placed on the analysis of language, particularly the language of science. They aimed to clarify how language is used in scientific theories and to distinguish between meaningful and meaningless statements.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Influence of Wittgenstein</strong>: Although not officially part of the Vienna Circle, Ludwig Wittgenstein’s early work, especially his “Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,” significantly influenced Logical Positivism. Wittgenstein argued that <em>much of philosophy consists of nonsensical propositions and that the role of philosophy should be to clarify thought and language</em>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ethical and Aesthetic Statements</strong>: Logical Positivists generally considered ethical and aesthetic statements to be expressions of emotions or subjective preferences, rather than statements that could be true or false.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The “positivism” component is linked to the movement’s commitment to a scientific and empirical approach to knowledge. Positivism, as a philosophical stance, argues that knowledge should be based on positive, observable facts and their logical and mathematical treatment. It rejects introspection and intuition as sources of knowledge and instead emphasizes empirical evidence obtained through observation and experimentation. Logical Positivists extended this approach by asserting that statements must be empirically verifiable (or analytically true) to be meaningful.</p> <hr/> <p>Somewhat to my surprise, Karl Popper is not a member of the Vienna circle even though they shared many intellectual engagements. Furthermore, Karl Popper is even critically oppositional. The Vienna Circle advocated for the verification principle, which held that a statement is meaningful only if it can be empirically <em>verified</em>. Popper challenged this view, proposing <em>falsificationism</em> instead. According to Popper, scientific theories cannot be conclusively verified but can be falsified. He argued that a theory is scientific if it is testable and can potentially be refuted by evidence. This approach places a greater emphasis on the role of empirical refutation rather than verification.</p> <p>Also, Popper was critical of what he called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">historicism</code> – the belief that <em>history unfolds according to deterministic laws or principles</em>. He argued that such theories, which <em>were often used to justify authoritarian regimes</em>, are fundamentally flawed. He believed that historicism led to totalitarianism because it promoted the idea that certain individuals or groups had access to inevitable truths about societal development, thus justifying their absolute rule. Popper advocated for what he termed an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open society</code>. An open society, in his view, is characterized by a democratic government, individual freedoms, and a critical attitude towards tradition and authority. It allows for change and improvement through rational and critical discourse, as opposed to the unquestioning acceptance of dogmatic principles.</p> <p>Just as Popper applied the <em>principle of falsifiability</em> to scientific theories, he suggested that political policies should also be subjected to critical scrutiny and should be alterable in the face of new evidence or arguments. He was wary of any political theory or system that claimed to have absolute or final answers.</p> <hr/> <p>According to Ayer, the expression of a value judgment is not a proposition since it can not be judged by right and wrong, the question of truth or falsehood does not here arise.</p> <p>Regarding ethics, Ayer points out that many theorists in ethics tend to treat statements about the causes and characteristics of our ethical feelings as if these statements were definitions of ethical concepts. For example, a theory might claim that an action is good if it promotes happiness. Here, the cause of the ethical feeling (happiness) is used to define the ethical concept (good). Ayer argues that ethical concepts are <em>pseudo-concepts</em>, since ethical concepts, in his view, is neither empirically verifiable or analytically correct.</p> <p>Ayer’s stance is closely associated with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emotivism</code>, a meta-ethical view that suggests <em>ethical statements do not assert propositions but express emotional attitudes</em>. According to emotivism, saying “Stealing is wrong” is akin to expressing one’s disapproval of stealing, rather than making an objective claim about the nature of stealing.</p> <h2 id="the-centrality-of-individual-rights">The Centrality of Individual Rights</h2> <blockquote> <p>In addition to faith in science, the Enlightenment’s central focus on individual rights differentiates its political philosophy from the ancient and medieval commitments to order and hierarchy. This focus brings the freedom of the individual to the center of arguments about politics. This move was signaled in the natural law tradition by a shift in emphasis from the logic of law to the idea of natural right.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hobbes contended that it was customary to conflate “Jus and Lex, law and right”. Yet he made the distinction that right, consisted in liberty to do, or to forbeare, whereas law, determines and binds to one of them. Similarly by Locke.</p> <p>John Locke’s oppinion on natural law is as the following. In his work <em>Essays on the Law of Nature</em>, Locke argues a moral law inherent in the world and discoverable through reason.</p> <p>Key points of Locke’s argument include:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Natural Law and Reason:</strong> Locke posits that natural law is an aspect of the natural world, similar to physical laws. According to him, this <em>moral law can be discovered through the use of reason, without the need for divine revelation</em>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Moral Obligations:</strong> He argues that <em>natural law imposes moral obligations on individuals</em>. These moral principles are universal and apply to all people, regardless of their culture or society.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rights and Duties:</strong> Locke’s view of natural law is closely tied to his ideas about individual rights and duties. He believes that natural law forms the basis for understanding human rights, especially the right to life, liberty, and property.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Foundation for Political Theory:</strong> These essays lay the groundwork for Locke’s later political theories, particularly those presented in his famous works, “Two Treatises of Government.” He uses the concept of natural law to argue for the rights of individuals and the limitations of governmental power.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Human Equality:</strong> Locke emphasizes the inherent equality of all human beings, derived from their natural state. This idea is a critical aspect of his argument against absolute monarchy and for the formation of governments based on the consent of the governed.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Religious Tolerance:</strong> Although not as explicitly developed in these essays as in his later works, Locke’s concept of natural law also leads to his advocacy for religious tolerance, seeing religious belief as a matter of individual conscience.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, Locke’s “Essays on the Law of Nature” propose that there is a moral law inherent in the natural world, understandable through human reason, and that this law underpins human rights and forms the basis for just and ethical governance.</p> <hr/> <p>John Locke’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">voluntarist theology</code> reflects his views on the nature of God and the relationship between divine will and moral law. The emphasis is on <em>the will will (voluntas in Latin, hence the name) of God of God as the primary or sole source of moral law</em>. Locke’s voluntarism posits that <em>moral laws are decrees of God’s will</em>. In this view, what is morally right or wrong is so because God wills it, and not necessarily because it aligns with any intrinsic moral truths or rational principles independent of God’s will. Locke emphasizes the <em>absolute freedom</em> and <em>omnipotence</em> of God. He argues that God’s will is not bound by any external standards or principles. Therefore, moral laws are a product of God’s free choice.</p> <p>While Locke is a proponent of reason and believes that human beings can discover moral truths through rational inquiry, he also upholds the importance of divine revelation. In his voluntarist theology, revelation plays a crucial role in imparting knowledge of God’s will, which might not be entirely accessible through reason alone. Locke’s voluntarism is tied to his rejection of innate ideas, a concept he famously critiques in his “Essay Concerning Human Understanding.” He argues against the notion that <em>moral principles are innately known</em>, instead positing that our understanding of moral laws comes from experience, reason, and revelation. Locke’s voluntarist approach suggests that moral obligations are ultimately grounded in obedience to God’s will. This perspective can lead to a form of ethical subjectivism, where moral truths depend on the decrees of a divine authority.</p> <hr/> <blockquote> <p>In Locke’s formulation, natural law dictates that man is subject to divine imperatives to live in certain ways, but, within the limits set by the law of nature, men can act in a godlike fashion. Man as maker has a maker’s knowledge of his intentional actions, and a natural right to dominion over man’s products. … Provided we do not violate natural law, we stand in the same relation to the objects we create as God stands to us; we own them just as he owns us.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="tensions-between-science-and-individual-rights">Tensions Between Science and Individual Rights</h2> <p>The two enlightenment values, the preoccupation of science and the commitment to individual rights, seem to be in contradiction with each other. Science is deterministic, concerned with discovering the laws that govern the universe, with human being included. This has potential for conflict with an ethic that emphasizes individual freedom, for now the freedom has to be subjugated to the laws (of nature, of God).</p> <p>In Locke’s theory, the freedom to comprehend natural law by one’s own lights supplied the basis of Locke’s right to resist, which could be invoked against the sovereign. No one is in a higher position to monopolize the right to interpret the scripture.</p> <blockquote> <p>We will see this tension surface repeatedly in the utilitarian, Marxist, and social contract traditions, without ever being fully resolved.</p> </blockquote> <h1 id="classical-utilitarianism">Classical Utilitarianism</h1> <p>Jeremy Bentham famously wrote that</p> <blockquote> <p>Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, <em>pain</em> and <em>pleasure</em>. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think: every effort we can make to throw off our subjection, will serve but to demonstrate and confirm it. In words a man may pretend to abjure their empire: but in reality he will remain subject to it all the while. The principle of utility recognizes this subjection, and assumes it for the foundation of that system, the object of which is to rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of reason and law. Systems which attempt to question it, deal in sounds instead of senses, in caprice instead of reason, in darkness instead of light.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some regimes indeed deals “in sounds instead of senses, in caprice instead of reason,” yet as long as they get only one thing right, as long as they supress the alternative, their reign will continue.</p> <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">principle of utility</code>, as Bentham explains, “approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever, according to the tendency which it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in other words, to promote or to oppose that happiness.”</p> <blockquote> <p>A century later Marx and Engels would write of a utopian order in which politics could be replaced by administration. Bentham believed that it could be done in eighteenth-century England.</p> </blockquote> <p>Funny enough, Marx thought very little of Jeremy Benthem. Marx wrote, in <em>Das Capita</em>, that Bentham was a “panegyric of bourgeois society,” and “With the driest naiveté he (Bentham) takes the modern shopkeeper, especially the English shopkeeper, as the normal man. Whatever is useful to this queer normal man, and to his world, is absolutely useful. This yard-measure, then, he applies to past, present, and future. The Christian religion, for example, is ‘useful,’ ‘because it forbids in the name of religion the same faults which the penal code condemns in the name of the law.’ Artistic criticism is ‘harmful,’ because it disturbs worthy people in their enjoyment of Martin Tupper, etc.”</p> <p>Bentham’s happiness principal, when applied to governments, requires us to maximize the greatest happiness of the greatest number in the community.</p> <p>Bentham defended an extensive system of political rights, but he saw rights as human artifacts, created by the legal system and enforced by the sovereign. He insisted that there are no rights without enforcement and no enforcement without government, a blunt statement of the view that would subsequently become known as legal positivism.</p> <h2 id="individual-versus-collective-utility-and-the-need-for-government">Individual Versus Collective Utility and the Need for Government</h2> <p>In Bentham’s <em>Principles of the Civil Code</em>, he wrote</p> <blockquote> <p>Law does not say to man, Work and I will reward you but it says: Labour, and by stopping the hand that would take them from you, I will ensure to you the fruits of your labour – its natural and sufficient reward, which without me you cannot preserve. If industry creates, it is law which preserves; if at the first moment we owe everything to labour, at the second, and every succeeding moment, we owe everything to law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Law should limit itself to ensuring that people can pursue utility for themselves.</p> <p>The necessity for having a government comes down to two things.</p> <ol> <li>Selfish behavior can be self-defeating. The problem of funding the provision of public goods is one of a class of market failures, where the market’s invisible hand leads to sub-optimal outcomes for all concerned.</li> </ol> <h1 id="synthesizing-rights-and-utility">Synthesizing rights and Utility</h1> <p>Contemptuous though he generally was of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">normative inquiry</code>, for the most part the Pareto of the Manual saw it as superfluous.</p> <p>Pareto’s denial of the possibility of interpersonal comparisons had the effect of importing a powerful doctrine of individual autonomy into the core logic of utilitarianism.</p> <hr/> <p>Although Pareto’s is not a normative theory, it nonetheless has normative implications. These derive from the pivotal role it ascribes to free individual choice as embodied in and expressed through market transactions.</p> <p>The core notion here is that of an indifference curve.

In a Kantian sense, these are part of the phenomenal world—models that help us systematize experience, rather than direct insights into the noumenon, which is the inherent essence, thing-in-themselves.</p> <p>For example, we can define the mass using inertia: $F = ma$. However, you can define the mass using another equally plausible equation: $F = mg$, which is the gravitational force. Different phenomena gives different noumena, we have two very different concepts of masses. The fact that they are equivalent to each other has profound meaning, this equivalence is not a analytical knowledge, but synthetic knowledge. It says that gravitation is actually the same thing as acceleration.</p> <hr/> <p>To have a feeling of what effective mass is, consider a rigid sphere of volume $V$, immersed in a perfect fluid (with zero viscosity) of density $\rho$. Let $m_ {0}$ be the “bare” mass of the ball, $\rho$ be the density of the water, and suppose</p> \[m_ {0}= \frac{1}{10} \rho V.\] <p>The buoyancy force is $\rho V$ and the gravitational force is $m_ {0}g$. The total force exerted on the ball is $9m_ {0} g$, so if we let go of the ball, it should accelerate upward with acceleration $9 g$. However, in reality this never happens, because the ball has to spread the water and that costs energy. There is also the frictional force, but that is only important when the ball has already gained some velocity. A more realistic case is that, when you let go the ball, the acceleration is around $a=\frac{3}{2}g$, instead $a=9 g$. Now if you insist on using $F=ma$ to define the mass of the moving ball, then we have</p> \[F = 9 m_ {0} g = m a = m \frac{3}{2} g\implies m = 6 m_ {0}.\] <p>We can say the when immersed in the liquid, the ball has effective mass $6m_ {0}$. But it is really the way that you decided to interpret the experiment.</p> <hr/> <p>I will not talk about the bump function $f(t)$ since it is really problematic. Actually, you can write down a smooth $C^{\infty}$ bump function explicitly. Define</p> \[h(t) = \begin{cases} e^{ -1 / t }, &amp; t&gt;0 , \\ 0, &amp; t\leq 0, \end{cases}\] <p>$h(t)$ is smooth. Given any real numbers $t_ {1}$ and $t_ {2}$ such that $t_ {1}&lt;t_ {2}$, define</p> \[f(t) = \frac{h(t-t_ {1})}{h(t-t_ {1})+h(t_ {2}-t)}\] <p>then</p> \[f(t) = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; t&lt;t_ {1}, \\ [0,1], &amp; t_ {1}&lt;t&lt;t_ {2}, \\ 1, &amp; t&gt;t_ {2}. \end{cases}\] <p>However, the free theory is not smoothly connected to the interacting theory. It is like expanding an algebraic equation</p> \[\epsilon x^{4}+ax^{2}+c=0,\] <p>when $\epsilon=0$ there are two roots, when $\epsilon \neq 0$ there are four roots, the extra two solutions goes to infinity as $\epsilon\to 0$, if we want to talk about these two extra roots, it doesn’t help to expand about $\epsilon=0$. So I’ll try to leave the bump function out of this talk.</p> <hr/> <p>In general, whenever a particle is interacting with a continuum system, may it be perfect fluid or electric-magnetic field, or any other field, the mass of the particle changes from when there is no interaction.</p> <p>Consider the meson only for now, the relevant terms are</p> \[\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\partial \phi)^{2} - \frac{1}{2}\mu_ {0}^{2}\phi^{2}-g\psi ^\ast \psi \phi+\cdots\] <p>where in the spirit of previous discussion, we write $\mu_ {0}$ instead of $\mu$. $\mu_ {0}$ is the bare mass of the meson, whose value can not be measured directly. Compare to our previous example of a ball, this Lagrangian corresponds to $F=m_ {0} a$ when the ball is free, not in water.</p> <p>In real world there is interaction. The physical mass $\mu$ of the meson is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dressed up</code> by the interaction,</p> \[\mu \neq \mu_ {0} \quad \text{ in the presence of interaction.}\] <p>Even there is interaction, the $S$ matrix element for vacuum to vacuum should be $1$. To ensure that, we need to introduce the constant counter term $a$, which should be added to the Lagrangian density, $\mathcal{L}=\cdots+a,$</p> \[a \text{ is fiexed by } \left\langle 0 \right\rvert S \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle=1.\] <p>We can write $\mu_ {0}^{2}=\nu^{2}-b$ and $m_ {0}^{2}=m^{2}-c$. This introduces the mass renormalization terms $\frac{1}{2} b\phi^{2}$ and $c \psi ^\ast\psi$,</p> \[b,c \text{ are fixed by } \left\langle \vec{p} \right\rvert S \left\lvert \vec{p}' \right\rangle = \delta^{3}(\vec{p}-\vec{p}').\] <p>where $\vec{p},\vec{p}’$ are momentum of mesons and nucleons.</p> <h1 id="feynman-rules">Feynman Rules</h1> <p>Wick diagrams are used to calculate the time-ordered operators, Feynman diagrams are used to calculate the $S$-matrix. Wick diagrams don’t pay attention to loose external lines, but Feynman diagram does.</p> <p>Consider the $\psi \psi\to\psi \psi$ scatter,</p> \[N(\vec{p}_ {1})+N(\vec{p}_ {2})\to N(\vec{p}_ {1}')+N(\vec{p}_ {2}'),\] <p>The $\mathcal{O}(g^{2})$ $S$-matrix element we want to calculate is $\left\langle \vec{p}_ {1}’\vec{p}_ {2}’ \right\rvert(S-1)\left\lvert \vec{p}_ {1}\vec{p}_ {2} \right\rangle$.

All the fields that are going to annihilate a particle in the initial state will be put to the right, where the initial state is. All the fields that are gonna contract particles in the final state will be put to the left, where the final state is. We will label the external legs with the momenta of corresponding particles.</p> <p>Let’s calculate the external lines first. With our convention, the contraction with an incoming particle with momentum $p$ gives a factor $e^{ -ip\cdot x }$. We have</p> \[\left\langle \vec{p}_ {1}' \vec{p}_ {2}' \right\rvert \mathcal{N}\left\lbrace \psi_ {1}^\ast \psi_ {1}\psi_ {2}^\ast \psi_ {2} \right\rbrace \left\lvert \vec{p}_ {1}\vec{p}_ {2} \right\rangle = \left\langle \vec{p}_ {1}' \vec{p}_ {2}' \right\rvert \psi_ {1}^\ast \psi_ {2}^\ast \psi_ {1} \psi_ {2} \left\lvert \vec{p}_ {1}\vec{p}_ {2} \right\rangle\] <p>which is a bunch of phases:</p> \[e^{ ix_ {1}\cdot(p_ {1}'-p_ {1})+ix_ {2}\cdot(p_ {2}'-p_ {2}) }+e^{ ix_ {1}\cdot(p_ {1}'-p_ {2})+ix_ {2}\cdot(p_ {2}'-p_ {1}) } + (x_ {1}\longleftrightarrow x_ {2}).\] <p>Note that the exchange of two vertices $x_ {1}\longleftrightarrow x_ {2}$ will cancel the factor $\frac{1}{2}$ in Dyson’s formula.</p> <p>The contraction between two meson field was calculated before,</p> \[\text{contraction} \left\lbrace \phi_ {1}\phi_ {2} \right\rbrace =\int \frac{d^{4}p}{(2\pi)^{4}} \, e^{ -iq(x_ {1}-x_ {2}) } \frac{i}{q^{2}-\mu^{2}+i\epsilon}.\] <p>Now we can insert all of them into the $\mathcal{O}(g^{2})$ term, the $x_ {1},x_ {2}$ integrals can be done explicitly since they just give a delta function,</p> \[\begin{align*} \left\langle \vec{p}_ {1}' \vec{p}_ {2}' \right\rvert S-1 \left\lvert \vec{p}_ {1}\vec{p}_ {2} \right\rangle =&amp; (-ig)^{2}\int \frac{d^{4}q}{(2\pi)^{4}} \, \frac{i}{q^{2}-\mu^{2}+i\epsilon} \\ &amp;\times \int d^{4}x_ {1} d^{4}x_ {2} \, e^{ ix_ {1}\cdot(p_ {1}'-p_ {1}-q)+ix_ {2}\cdot(p_ {2}'-p_ {2}+q) }+(p_ {1}\longleftrightarrow p_ {2}). \end{align*}\] <p>Since</p> \[\int d^{4}x \, e^{ ipx } = (2\pi)^{4}\delta (p)\] <p>and $\delta(x-a)\delta(x-b)=\delta(a-b)\delta(x-a)$, we have</p> \[\begin{align*} \left\langle \vec{p}_ {1}' \vec{p}_ {2}' \right\rvert S-1 \left\lvert \vec{p}_ {1}\vec{p}_ {2} \right\rangle =&amp; (-ig)^{2}(2\pi)^{4} \delta^{4}(p_ {1}'+p_ {2}'-p_ {1}-p_ {2})\\ &amp; \times \int \frac{d^{4q}}{(2\pi)^{4}} \,(2\pi)^{4} \frac{i}{q^{2}-\mu^{2}+\epsilon}[\delta^{4}(p_ {1}'-p_ {1}-q)+\delta^{4}(p_ {2}'-p_ {1}+q)]. \end{align*}\] <p>The RHS of the first line gives us the conservation of total momentum. We can define the invariant Feynman amplitude $\mathcal{A}$ as</p> \[\left\langle f \right\rvert S-1\left\lvert i \right\rangle =i (2\pi)^{4}\delta^{4}\left( \sum p \right) \mathcal{A}\] <p>Then in our example</p> \[\mathcal{A} = (-ig)^{2} \frac{1}{(p_ {1}'-p_ {1})^{2}-\mu^{2}+i\epsilon} + (-ig)^{2} \frac{1}{(p_ {2}'-p_ {1})^{2}-\mu^{2}+i\epsilon} ,\] <p>they corresponds to the following two diagrams:</p> <p><strong>Draw $t,u$-channel diagrams and calculate one of them.</strong></p> <p>See page 256 of Coleman’s lecture.</p> <p><strong>Talk about a 1-loop example</strong> $\mathcal{O}(g^{4})$ diagram.</p> <p>The contractions are called propagators, which is not really some particle propagating in spacetime. Factors like $i / (q^{2}-\mu^{2}+i\epsilon)$ give the probability amplitude, in this metaphorical language, for the virtual particle going between two vertices. They describe how a virtual particle propagates from one vertex to another. For this reason, they are called Feynman propagators. The language, I stress, is purely metaphorical. If you don’t want to use it, don’t use it. But then you’ll find 90% of the physicists in the world will be unintelligible to you when they give seminars. It’s very convenient, but it should not be taken too seriously.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>March 24th</strong></p> <hr/> <h1 id="feynman-diagrams-in-model-3-to-order-g2">Feynman diagrams in Model 3 to order $g^{2}$</h1> <p>The a counterterm is just a number. I don’t need a special diagrammatic rule for that. The a counterterm has no momentum associated with it, and its delta function has an argument of zero. If the system were in a box, the term $(2\pi)^{4}\delta^{4}(0)$ would turn into $VT$, the volume of spacetime in the box. This counterterm is designed to cancel all the vacuum bubble diagrams, those without external lines, which you will see also have a factor of $(2\pi)^{4}\delta^{4}(0)$. Like the counterterm a, the counterterms $b$ and $c$ will be expressed as infinite power series in the coupling constant $g$.

My journey at IMP began on January 3rd, and the past month has swept by like a fleeting dream. It's incredible how swiftly time passes when you're fully engaged in life's riches! Over the last 20 days, I've learnt so much, from foundational principles to specific calculation techniques. Alas, as my collaborators take their leave, so must I. I'm now set to chase the sunshine along the warm shores of the South China Sea, seeking joy there with my girlfriend. I look forward to reuniting with all of you after the Chinese Lunar New Year!

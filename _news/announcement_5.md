After spending two and a half years at Henan University, it is time to bid farewell to the School of Mathematics and Statistics. I arrived in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and experienced that magical-realist period firsthand. The first year here was quite pleasant, but after that, the working environment took a sharp downturn. This past year and a half has beenâ€¦ regrettable, to say the least. By the way why isn't there a website like ratemyprofessor in China?

On the bright side, even during those difficult times, I learned a great deal from fellow postdocs and professors, both within the university and beyond, but especially from my old friends/mentors/supervisors at Institute of Modern Physics. The only reason I am still doing science is because of them. So, it certainly wasn't time wasted.

In the coming two weeks, I'll be visiting the School of Physics and Astronomy at Sun Yat-Sen University to learn more about gauge Abelian decomposition. I'm looking forward to it!

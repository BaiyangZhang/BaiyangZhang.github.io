If a vacuum sector Hamiltonian is regularized by an energy cutoff, how is the one-kink sector Hamiltonian regularized? We find that it is not regularized by an energy cutoff, indeed normal modes of all energies are present in the kink Hamiltonian, but rather the decomposition of the field into normal mode operators yields coefficients which lie on a constrained surface that forces them to become small for energies above the cutoff. This explains the old observation that an energy cutoff of the kink Hamiltonian leads to an incorrect one-loop kink mass. To arrive at our conclusion, we impose that the regularized kink sector Hamiltonian is unitarily equivalent to the regularized vacuum sector Hamiltonian. This condition implies that the two regularized Hamiltonians have the same spectrum and so guarantees that the kink Hamiltonian yields the correct kink mass.

In the context of quantum field theory, the expectation value of any observable receives contribution from 1) perturbative expansion in coupling constant, which is an asymptotic power series and 2) non-perturbative sectors, based on topologically non-trivial solutions of the model, such as kinks, vortices, etc. The quantum corrections to classical solitonic solutions form yet another asymptotic power series. Latest developments regarding the non-perturbative nature of quantum field theory has revealed profound connections between perturbative expansion and classical topological contribution, in our talk we will emphasize on the equally profound connection between perturbative sector and quantum corrections in kink sector, and we argue that such connection is best described by the language of category theory. Further we propose that the the inverse quantization functor can be used to define a groupoid fiberation of quantum category over classical category, yet it is unclear if such structure satisfies pullback theorem and thus form a discrete stack.

In 1+1 dimensional phi-fourth theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking, the kink mass receives quantum correction about the classical kink solution, which forms an asymptotic series in the coupling constant, just like the perturbative expansion. Recent advancements in resurgence theory has revealed profound connection between perturbative expansions and classical solitonic contributions, in our talk, we'll focus on the significant connection between perturbative contribution and quantum corrections about the kink. The perturbative calculation takes place in trivial vacuum background, while the solitonic calculation takes place in the kink background, they form distinct superselection sectors, yet bridged by a unitary transform. We will construct this bridge explicitly with proper normalization. We argue that category theory offers the best framework to describe this relationship. Additionally, we propose that the inverse quantization functors define a groupoid fibration, although it remains to be seen if this structure fulfills the pullback theorem and thus forms a discrete stack.

In 1+1-dimensional phi-fourth theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking, the kink mass receives quantum corrections around the classical kink solution, forming an asymptotic series in the coupling constant, akin to perturbative expansions. Recent advances in resurgence theory have unveiled a deep connection between perturbative and solitonic contributions, but typically at leading order. Our talk will explore the crucial connection between perturbative contributions and higher-order quantum corrections around the kink, focusing on the ground state Hamiltonian. We will construct a bridge between two superselection sectors, i.e., the trivial vacuum sector and kink sector, with proper normalization. We argue that category theory provides the optimal framework for describing this relationship, where the inverse quantization functors define a groupoid fibration over the category of Poisson manifolds.

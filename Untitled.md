$$
I_ {1} =\int_ {-\infty}^{\infty} dp \,    p^{2} (1+p^{2})^{3/2} \text{csch}^{2}(p)
$$

where $\text{csch}$ is the hyperbolic function 

$$
\text{csch}(x) = \frac{1}{\sinh(x)} , \quad \sinh(x)= \frac{e^{ x }-e^{ -x }}{2}.
$$

1. "Referee #2 wrote raised 3 criticisms", should we delete one of "wrote" and "raised"?

2. You mentioned in the five to last line on page one:

Refs [1,2] have been applied to cosmology in hep-th/0511166,...

I googled this paper and it is about quantum Hall effect, not cosmology? 



$$
\int_ {-\infty}^{\infty} dp \,  p^{2}(1+p^{2})^{\frac{3}{2}} \text{csch}^{2}
$$

by expanding $(1+p^{2})^{3/2}$, but the result is some crazy alternating series

$$
\frac{\pi ^2}{3}+\frac{\pi ^4}{10}+\frac{\pi ^6}{56}-\frac{\pi ^8}{240}+\frac{5 \pi ^{10}}{2816}+\frac{691 \pi ^{12}}{199680}-\frac{21 \pi ^{14}}{2048}+\cdots
$$

not even an asymptotic series. Bob Dingle has a book on asymptotic methods of special functions but doesn't seem to help either.

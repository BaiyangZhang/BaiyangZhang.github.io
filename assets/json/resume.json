    "summary": " I obtained my Ph.D. at the Institute of Modern Physics, University of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (IMP-UCAS) in theoretical physics in December, 2017. Before this one I have finished two terms of postdocs at 1) the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and 2) in the Nuclear Theory group at the University of Minnesota under the supervision of Prof. Aleksey Cherman. I am primarily focused on understanding the phase structure of Yang-Mills-like theory (with adjoint and fundamental matter fields) on topological nontrivial manifolds, with emphasis on the role played by various topological objects.",

### Enlightenment Politics

>f there is a single overarching idea shared in common by adherents to different strands of Enlightenment thinking, it is faith in the power of human reason to understand the true nature of our circumstances and ourselves. Human improvement is measured by the yardstick of **individual rights** that embody, and protect, **human freedom**.

>Descartes announced that he was in search of propositions that are impossible to doubt. His famous example, known as the `cogito`, was ‘‘I think, therefore I am.’’

>Immanuel Kant defined in `The Critique of Pure Reason` (1781), of placing knowledge ‘‘on the secure path of a science.’’

>These developments in philosophy reflected and reinforced the emergence of modern scientific consciousness.

Such ideas, as necessary conditions for the development of natural science (not merely technology), seems to never had appeared in China. Year 1781 is the year 乾隆四十六年 in China, one of the most closed, ignorant, and autocratic era in history. 

>During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the hallmark of scientific knowledge was indubitable certainty, ethics, political philosophy, and the human sciences were regarded as superior to the natural sciences. This view seems strange from the vantage point of the twenty-first century, when fields like physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology have all advanced with astonishing speed to discoveries that would have been unimaginable in the eighteenth century.

#### The Workmanship Ideal of Knowledge

>The first distinctive feature of the early Enlightenment concerns the range of `a priori knowledge`, the kind of knowledge that either follows from definitions or is otherwise deduced from covering principals. This is the kind of knowledge Descartes had in mind when he formulated his cogito and that Kant located in the realm of ‘‘analytic judgments.’

**Epistemology** is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge. The term comes from the Greek words "episteme," meaning knowledge or understanding, and "logos," meaning study or discourse. Epistemology addresses questions such as:

- What is knowledge?
- How is knowledge acquired?
- What do people know?
- How do we know what we know?
- What are the limits of human knowledge?
- What makes beliefs justified or rational?

In exploring these questions, epistemology deals with the definition of knowledge and its scope and limits. It often involves debating between different theories of knowledge, such as empiricism (the idea that knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience), rationalism (the idea that reason is the main source of knowledge), and constructivism (the idea that knowledge is constructed by individuals through their interactions with the world).

Immanuel Kant distinguished between two types of judgments: `analytic` and `synthetic`. These distinctions are central to his philosophy, especially in his work "Critique of Pure Reason."

1. **Analytic Judgments**: An analytic judgment is one where the predicate (the part of the sentence that says something about the subject) is contained within the subject itself. The truth of an analytic judgment is derived from the meanings of the words involved and logical reasoning. They are tautological in nature and do not add any new information about the world. For example, the statement "All bachelors are unmarried" is analytic because the predicate "unmarried" is part of the definition of the subject "bachelor."

2. **Synthetic Judgments**: A synthetic judgment, on the other hand, is one where the predicate adds something to the subject that is not contained within it. The truth of a synthetic judgment is determined through how our concepts relate to the world and cannot be known just by understanding the meanings of the words. They require empirical investigation or intuition. For instance, "The cat is on the mat" is a synthetic judgment because the concept of "the cat" does not inherently include the concept of "being on the mat."

Kant's distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments is fundamental to his epistemology, particularly in addressing the question of how human beings can have knowledge about the world. He further introduced the concept of "synthetic a priori" judgments, which are synthetic judgments that are known independently of experience (a priori), like mathematical truths.

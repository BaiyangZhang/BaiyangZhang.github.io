### Enlightenment Politics

>f there is a single overarching idea shared in common by adherents to different strands of Enlightenment thinking, it is faith in the power of human reason to understand the true nature of our circumstances and ourselves. Human improvement is measured by the yardstick of **individual rights** that embody, and protect, **human freedom**.

>Descartes announced that he was in search of propositions that are impossible to doubt. His famous example, known as the `cogito`, was ‘‘I think, therefore I am.’’

>Immanuel Kant defined in `The Critique of Pure Reason` (1781), of placing knowledge ‘‘on the secure path of a science.’’

>These developments in philosophy reflected and reinforced the emergence of modern scientific consciousness.

Such ideas, as necessary conditions for the development of natural science (not merely technology), seems to never had appeared in China. Year 1781 is the year 乾隆四十六年 in China, one of the most closed, ignorant, and autocratic era in history. 

>During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when the hallmark of scientific knowledge was indubitable certainty, ethics, political philosophy, and the human sciences were regarded as superior to the natural sciences. This view seems strange from the vantage point of the twenty-first century, when fields like physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology have all advanced with astonishing speed to discoveries that would have been unimaginable in the eighteenth century.

#### The Workmanship Ideal of Knowledge

>The first distinctive feature of the early Enlightenment concerns the range of `a priori knowledge`, the kind of knowledge that either follows from definitions or is otherwise deduced from covering principals. This is the kind of knowledge Descartes had in mind when he formulated his cogito and that Kant located in the realm of ‘‘analytic judgments.’

**Epistemology** is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature, origin, and limits of human knowledge. The term comes from the Greek words "episteme," meaning knowledge or understanding, and "logos," meaning study or discourse. Epistemology addresses questions such as:

- What is knowledge?
- How is knowledge acquired?
- What do people know?
- How do we know what we know?
- What are the limits of human knowledge?
- What makes beliefs justified or rational?

In exploring these questions, epistemology deals with the definition of knowledge and its scope and limits. It often involves debating between different theories of knowledge, such as empiricism (the idea that knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience), rationalism (the idea that reason is the main source of knowledge), and constructivism (the idea that knowledge is constructed by individuals through their interactions with the world).

Immanuel Kant distinguished between two types of judgments: `analytic` and `synthetic`. These distinctions are central to his philosophy, especially in his work "Critique of Pure Reason."

1. **Analytic Judgments**: An analytic judgment is one where the predicate (the part of the sentence that says something about the subject) is contained within the subject itself. The truth of an analytic judgment is derived from the meanings of the words involved and logical reasoning. They are tautological in nature and do not add any new information about the world. For example, the statement "All bachelors are unmarried" is analytic because the predicate "unmarried" is part of the definition of the subject "bachelor."

2. **Synthetic Judgments**: A synthetic judgment, on the other hand, is one where the predicate adds something to the subject that is not contained within it. The truth of a synthetic judgment is determined through how our concepts relate to the world and cannot be known just by understanding the meanings of the words. They require empirical investigation or intuition. For instance, "The cat is on the mat" is a synthetic judgment because the concept of "the cat" does not inherently include the concept of "being on the mat."

Kant's distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments is fundamental to his epistemology, particularly in addressing the question of how human beings can have knowledge about the world. He further introduced the concept of "synthetic a priori" judgments, which are synthetic judgments that are known independently of experience (a priori), like mathematical truths.

The "creationist" or "workmanship" theory in political science, often associated with the work of John Locke, is a theory of political obligation. It suggests that political authority and legitimacy derive from the consent of the governed, likening the role of the government or ruler to that of a craftsman or creator who constructs a system with the consent and for the benefit of the people.

This theory is rooted in the idea that political and social structures are artificial constructs, made by human beings, unlike natural phenomena. The "creationist" aspect implies that political structures are deliberately created or constructed, rather than organically evolved. The "workmanship" aspect emphasizes the idea that the creators or rulers of these structures have a responsibility to the people they govern, similar to how a craftsman is responsible for the quality and function of their creation.

Locke's theory was revolutionary at its time because it challenged the prevailing notion of the divine right of kings, suggesting instead that political authority is justified only when it serves the interests of the governed and respects their rights. This theory laid the groundwork for modern concepts of democracy, individual rights, and the social contract.

Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, two prominent philosophers, had distinct views on natural law, reflecting their differing perspectives on human nature and the ideal structure of society.

Hobbes, in his work "Leviathan," presented a rather pessimistic view of human nature. He believed that in the state of nature (a hypothetical condition without government or laws), humans are driven by self-interest and a desire for self-preservation, leading to a "war of all against all" (bellum omnium contra omnes). In this state, life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

For Hobbes, natural law is a set of precepts or general rules, *discovered by reason*, which prohibit anything destructive to one's own life. *It’s based on the right of every individual to preserve their own life*, leading to the conclusion that humans should seek peace. This is where his famous concept of the social contract comes into play: individuals surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of a ruler (or a ruling assembly) to ensure their own safety and peace. Thus, Hobbes's natural law is fundamentally about self-preservation and the avoidance of harm to others as a means of securing one's own safety.

Locke's view, as articulated in "Two Treatises of Government," is more optimistic about human nature. He believed that in the state of nature, humans live in a state of equality and freedom, not inherently prone to violence or war. For Locke, the *law of nature is a moral guide based on the belief that God has given the world to all people in common*. It teaches that, since all are equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in their life, health, liberty, or possessions. 

Locke’s natural law is grounded in the rights to life, liberty, and property. It includes the idea that people have the obligation to respect the rights of others. His social contract theory suggests that people form governments to protect these natural rights. If a government fails to do so, citizens have the right to overthrow it. This view laid the groundwork for modern democracy and significantly influenced the development of political philosophy in the Western world.

So, Hobbes saw natural law as a means of avoiding the brutal state of nature through self-preservation and peace, whereas Locke viewed natural law as a moral guide ensuring equality and the inherent rights of life, liberty, and property.

>A basic issue for Locke and many of his contemporaries was the ontological status of natural law and in particular its relation to God’s will.

In this sentence, "ontological status" refers to the fundamental nature or essence of natural law, especially in relation to its existence and its relationship to God's will. Ontology, in philosophy, is the study of being or existence, and it deals with questions concerning what entities exist or can be said to exist, and how such entities can be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences.

So, when discussing the "ontological status of natural law" in the context of John Locke and his contemporaries, the focus is on understanding the very essence of natural law: whether it exists as an objective reality independent of human beings, how it relates to or derives from God's will, and what its fundamental characteristics are. This was a central topic in the philosophical and theological debates of that era, particularly in the context of determining the basis and legitimacy of moral and legal principles. Locke and many others were engaged in trying to understand whether natural laws were inherent aspects of the universe, ordained by God, or whether they were constructs of human reason and society.

"Will-centered" refers to the philosophical position known as voluntarism. This is a theory that emphasizes the role of the will, either divine or human, in various philosophical contexts. In the context of Locke's moral and political writings, being "will-centered" or a voluntarist means that Locke ultimately leaned towards the view that natural law and moral principles are determined by the will, particularly the will of God, rather than being inherent or objective truths that exist independently of any will.

In Locke's time, the debate about the nature of natural law often centered around whether natural laws were intrinsic to the universe (a position known as intellectualism or rationalism) or whether they were decrees of God's will (voluntarism). A will-centered or voluntarist approach suggests that moral and legal norms derive their authority from an act of will, particularly the divine will, rather than from reason alone or from the inherent nature of reality. In this view, what is right or wrong, just or unjust, is so because God wills it to be that way, and human beings understand and follow these laws through revelation, religious teachings, or other means of discerning God's will.

>Locke distinguished "ectype"’ from "archetype" ideas: ectypes are general ideas of substances, and archetypes are ideas constructed by man.

John Locke's distinction between "ectype" and "archetype" ideas is a crucial aspect of his epistemological theory, which he discusses in his work "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding." This distinction is part of his broader inquiry into the nature of human knowledge and understanding.

In Locke's philosophy, archetypes are the original models or patterns from which copies are made. They are the fundamental, primary ideas that exist in the mind of God or, in a more secular interpretation, the perfect, abstract forms of things. When Locke refers to archetypes as ideas constructed by man, he means that these are the ideal standards or criteria we hold in our minds for categorizing and understanding the world. They represent our understanding of what the essential characteristics of a particular thing are.

For instance, the archetype of a tree would be the idealized concept or mental representation of what a tree is supposed to be. This archetype is not derived from any particular tree but is a kind of composite or abstracted idea of "treeness" that we use to recognize and categorize individual trees.

Ectypes, on the other hand, are derivative or secondary ideas. They are the imperfect copies or generalizations that we derive from our experience with individual instances in the world. Ectype ideas are more about the general ideas of substances we form based on our sensory experiences and observations. When we see many individual trees, for example, we form a general idea of what a tree is - this is an ectype. It's a more practical, experiential idea based on the aggregation of real-world instances.

In summary, Locke's distinction between archetype and ectype ideas can be understood as a differentiation between the idealized, abstract concepts we hold in our minds as standards (archetypes) and the more practical, general ideas we form based on our sensory experience of the world (ectypes). Archetypes are about the essence or ideal form of things, while ectypes are about the general, often imperfect, concepts we derive from actual experiences.

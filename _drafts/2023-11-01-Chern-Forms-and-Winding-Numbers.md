## The Yangâ€“Mills Winding Number

Recall how the instanton was constructed. We patched the $\mathbb{R}^{4}$ space with two parts, the "inner circle" which is four dimensional disk and the "outer circle" which is the rest. The intersection between them is a $3$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^{3}$.

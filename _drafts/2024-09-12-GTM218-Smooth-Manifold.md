# Topological manifolds


The simplest manifolds are topological manifolds, which are topolgocial spaces with certain properties so that we can treat them locally as $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ or $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. However, if you want to do calculus on manifolds, we need:

- Some notion of "smoothness". 
- To be able to study the space as itself, without the baggage of an ambient space. (General Relativity for example.)

Thus we will think of smooth manifolds as sets with two layers of structure: 1) topological structure and 2) smooth structure. 

## Topological structure

A topological space $M$ upgrades to a topological `manifold` if it satisfies the following properties:

1. It is 2-Hausdorff. Recall that according to separation axioms (sometimes called Tychonoff separation axioms),  The separation axioms are denoted with the letter "T" after the German Trennungsaxiom ("separation axiom"), and increasing numerical subscripts denote stronger and stronger properties. Let X be a topological space. Then two points $x$ and y in X are **topologically distinguishable** if they do not have exactly the same [neighbourhoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(mathematics) "Neighbourhood (mathematics)") (or equivalently the same open neighbourhoods); that is, at least one of them has a neighbourhood that is not a neighbourhood of the other (or equivalently there is an [open set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set "Open set") that one point belongs to but the other point does not). That is, at least one of the points does not belong to the other's [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(topology) "Closure (topology)"). Two points $x$ and $y$ are **separated** if each of them has a neighbourhood that is not a neighbourhood of the other. $T_ {0}$ separation means that any two distinct points are topologically indistinguishable, $T_ {1}$ means any two distinct points are separable, $T_ {2}$ means Hausdorff, $T_ {2 \frac{1}{2}}$ means and two distinct points are separated by closed set.

2. It is second-countable. Recall that second countable means that the topology can be generated by countable basis, that is a set of countable open sets. In contrast, first countable is more local, it says that any point in the manifold has a countable local basis.
3. $M$ is locally Euclidean of dimension $n$. 

Why do we need these properties? Because we want to ensure that manifolds behave in the ways we expect from our experience with Euclidean spaces.

Introduce chats and atlas, the coordinate domain, coordinate ball, etc. 

Explain $\mathbb{R}P^{n}$ space, the real projective space as an example.

In the context of topology, the term **precompact** (also called **relatively compact**) means that a subset of a topological space has a **compact closure**.

Specifically, a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be **precompact** if the **closure** of $A$ (denoted $\overline{A}$) is compact. This means that while the subset itself may not be compact, when you take its closure (the smallest closed set containing $A$), it becomes a compact set.

**lemma.** Every topological manifold has a countable basis of precompact coordinate balls.

Introduce the connectivity property of a topological manifold.

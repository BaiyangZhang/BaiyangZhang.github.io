Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (AQFT) is an approach to quantum field theory that emphasizes the algebraic structure of quantum observables and their relationships. At its core, quantum field theory (QFT) is the framework that combines classical field theory (like electromagnetism or fluid dynamics, where fields are functions defined at every point in space and time) with quantum mechanics (where physical quantities are described by probabilities and observables are operators with uncertainties). In the algebraic approach, instead of focusing on fields and their dynamics directly, *we concentrate on the algebra of observables*. Observables are quantities that can be measured, such as energy, momentum, or electric charge. In AQFT, these observables are represented by mathematical objects in an algebra, which is a collection of elements equipped with algebraic operations like addition and multiplication that follow certain rules.

In AQFT, the universe is divided into regions of space-time, and to each region, we associate an algebra of observables. This encapsulates the idea that physical experiments are local; **essential locality means that you can only measure what's happening in your immediate vicinity**. These local algebras must obey certain compatibility conditions, such as causality (the principle that effects cannot occur before their causes).

In this context, a *state represents a physical situation or a configuration of the field*. Mathematically, a state is a function that assigns a number to each observable, which can be interpreted as the expectation value (or average outcome) of measuring that observable in the given state. A state is also a vector in a Hilbert space, or even a pre-Hilbert space.

Consider a simple example, the free scalar field. In AQFT:

- We define algebras of observables for regions of space-time. For the free scalar field, these observables might include things like the field value at a point or the total energy in a region.

- The relationships between these observables follow from the properties of the field, such as its equations of motion (e.g., the Klein-Gordon equation for a free scalar field).

- A state in this context might represent the vacuum (the lowest energy state), the kink or a state with a certain number of fundamental particles, which we sometimes call mesons. The state allows us to calculate expectation values, like the average energy density in a region.

**Why Algebraic?**

The *algebraic approach offers a high level of mathematical rigor and generality*. It allows for the treatment of quantum field theories in a way that is independent of specific representations or field configurations, *focusing instead on the relationships between observables*. This can be particularly powerful in dealing with complex theories or in situations where the space-time background is not fixed, such as in quantum gravity.

Algebraic Quantum Field Theory is a framework that abstracts away from the specific details of fields and particles to focus on the algebraic relationships between observables. This approach offers deep insights into the structure of quantum theories, particularly in understanding the principles of locality, causality, and the nature of quantum states.

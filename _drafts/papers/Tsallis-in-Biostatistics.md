# Introduction


## 1.1 Brief History of Tsallis Statistics and Its Success

Tsallis statistics, introduced by Constantino Tsallis in 1988, extends traditional Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics by introducing a generalization of entropy, known as Tsallis entropy. This extension incorporates a parameter qq that allows for more flexible descriptions of complex, non-extensive systems. Over the years, Tsallis statistics has found applications in various fields, including physics, finance, and information theory, due to its ability to model systems with long-range interactions, memory effects, and fractal structures. Its success in capturing the behavior of complex systems has prompted exploration into its applicability to other domains, such as biostatistics.

## 1.2 History of Logistic Regression, Its Advantages, and Shortcomings

Logistic regression, introduced by David Cox in the early 1950s, has become a cornerstone technique in statistical modeling, particularly for binary classification tasks. It is widely used in medical statistics, economics, and social sciences due to its simplicity and interpretability. The model estimates the probability of an event occurring based on a set of predictors using the logistic function, often referred to as the sigmoid function. Despite its popularity, logistic regression has limitations, such as its sensitivity to outliers, assumptions of linearity in the log-odds, and inability to capture complex non-linear relationships in the data. These limitations can be especially problematic in biological contexts, such as cancer prediction, where the relationships between genes and outcomes are often complex and non-linear.

## 1.3 The Current Research on Sigmoid Functions and Their Generalizations

The logistic sigmoid function has been a widely used model in binary classification, but its limitations have spurred interest in generalizations. Researchers have explored various forms of sigmoid-like functions, including the generalization of the logistic function using Tsallis entropy. The q-logarithmic function, which generalizes the standard logarithm by introducing a parameter q, has shown promise in modeling complex data distributions in ways that the traditional sigmoid cannot. These generalized sigmoid functions allow for greater flexibility in capturing data patterns and have been incorporated into alternative forms of regression, including generalized linear models.

## 1.4 Current Studies on Gradient Methods and Iteration Step Size

The gradient method, particularly gradient descent, is a widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning and statistical modeling. The iterative process relies on updating model parameters to minimize a loss function. However, the choice of step size (or learning rate) remains a critical challenge. An inappropriate step size can lead to slow convergence or even divergence in the optimization process. Recent research has focused on adaptive learning rates, momentum-based methods, and second-order optimization techniques to improve convergence rates and stability. The selection of step size is particularly important in logistic regression models with generalized sigmoid functions, as the complex loss landscape requires more careful tuning.

#### 1.5 The Application of Tsallis Statistics in Biostatistics, Especially in Cancer Studies

In the realm of biostatistics, Tsallis statistics is gaining traction as a tool for modeling non-linear relationships between genetic factors and disease outcomes. Recent studies have applied Tsallis entropy and its generalizations to cancer research, where gene expression data is used to predict cancer risk. Tsallis-based methods provide a more nuanced approach to modeling gene-environment interactions, particularly in cases where the standard logistic regression may fail to capture underlying complexities. This paper explores the integration of the q-log function within logistic regression models for binary classification in cancer studies, providing a novel approach to analyzing the genetic data of cancer patients. Furthermore, the use of the Yodel index for evaluating model fitting quality provides an additional metric for assessing the effectiveness of this generalized model.

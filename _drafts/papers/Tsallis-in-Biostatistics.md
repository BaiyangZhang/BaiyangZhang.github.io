# Introduction


## 1. History of Non-Extensive Entropy: Rényi and Tsallis Entropy


Classical entropy measures i.e. Shannon entropy or Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, regardless of their immense success, are confined by their principle properties, such as the requirement of extensivity, which limited their application in describing complex systems exhibiting unusual properties, such as multifractal structure or non-equilibrium behavior. 

Rényi

Non-extensive entropy emerged as a modification of traditional entropy theories in response to complex systems that do not follow the additivity property of classical entropy. Tsallis entropy, a generalization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, became widely applied in various fields, including physics, biology, and information theory. Tsallis entropy is particularly useful in systems exhibiting long-range interactions, fractal structures, or complex dynamics, often characterized by non-extensive statistical behaviors.




## 2. Historical Development of Logistic Regression Method

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification. It has been widely employed in various fields, particularly in biostatistics, due to its simplicity and efficiency in modeling binary outcomes. Over the years, logistic regression has been extended to handle multi-class classification problems and to incorporate regularization techniques.


## 3. Study of Sigmoid Function in Logistic Regression

The sigmoid function is a cornerstone in logistic regression, used to map the linear output of the model into a probability. It transforms any real-valued input to a range between 0 and 1, enabling its interpretation as a probability. The study of the sigmoid function's properties and its adaptations has been an area of interest, particularly when extending logistic regression to complex applications, including gene expression data in biostatistics.

## 4. Gradient Method in Logistic Regression and Recent Developments

The gradient method, especially gradient descent, is a popular optimization technique used to minimize the cost function in logistic regression models. The choice of step length (learning rate) is critical for ensuring convergence, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. Recent developments have focused on adaptive learning rate methods and optimization techniques that enhance the efficiency and accuracy of logistic regression.

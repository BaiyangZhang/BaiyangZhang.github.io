I have put together a short example of using Mathematica's Quantum package to solve the harmonic oscillator problem [here](https://github.com/BaiyangZhang/BaiyangZhang.github.io/blob/master/assets/Mathematica/ExampleHarmonicOscillator.nb), hopefully I can apply this package to my current project on the quantum corrections of kink mass.

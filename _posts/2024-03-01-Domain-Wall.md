# Introduction

Domain walls in theoretical physics are fascinating phenomena that arise in a variety of contexts, from condensed matter physics to cosmology. They are a type of topological soliton that occurs when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken. In simpler terms, domain walls can be thought of as boundaries between different phases or domains where the order parameter (some scalar degree of freedom) differs on either side.


When kink solutions are placed in more than one spatial dimension, they become extended planar structures called “domain walls.” For example, in $3+1$ dimension, a flat $\mathcal{Z}_ {2}$ domain wall in $yz$-plane is 

$$
\phi(t,x,y,z) = \eta\, \tanh\left( \sqrt{ \frac{\lambda}{2} } \, \eta x \right).
$$

The energy density is given by that of $\mathcal{Z}_ {2}$ kink, the our convention it reads

$$
\mathcal{E} = \frac{\lambda \eta^{4}}{2} \cosh^{-4}\left( \sqrt{ \frac{\lambda}{2} } \, \eta x \right)
$$

since the Lagrangian is 

$$
\frac{1}{2} (\partial \phi)^{2}  - \frac{\lambda}{4} (\phi^{2} - \eta^{2})^{2}
$$

and the $\mathcal{Z} _2$ kink solution (with center at $x=0$) reads

$$
\phi_ {k} (x,t) = \eta \tanh\left( \sqrt{ \frac{\lambda}{2} } \eta x \right).
$$

The new aspects of domain walls are that they can be curved and deformations can propagate along them. Another feature of the planar domain wall is that it is invariant under boosts in the plane parallel to the wall. This is simply because the solution is independent of t, y and z and any transformations of these coordinates do not affect the solution.

The characteristic length of a kink is roughly speaking inverse to some mass, the mass of the fluctuating field in the kink sector. For distance scale much larger than that of a kink, we can regard it as a point particle. Recall that in the context of general relativity, the true trajectory of a particle through spacetime is such that it extremizes the proper time. In curved spacetime the trajectory (geodesic) followed by a free particle *maximizes the proper time* compared to nearby paths. Particles are "lazy" in the sense that they try to maximize the time spent to get to point B from point A. The action can be written as 

$$
S_ {1+1} = -M \int d\tau ,

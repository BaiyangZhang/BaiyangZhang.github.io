### Latex

Needless to say that LaTeX is the best language so far to write mathematical formula. A user-friendly introduction can be found online called [LaTeX for Complete Novices](https://www.dickimaw-books.com/latex/novices/), which can be read for free. After having gained a pretty good general idea of how to use Latex, other online resource might come in handy in everyday life working with LaTeX, I used to use the famous *Latex Companion* as a dictionary, but nowadays I found GPT4 to be most helpful. 

Also I like to edit Latex file on some local editor, such as WinEDT. The best online editor is [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project). 

### Obsidian + Markdown

Obsidian can be installed online. Make sure you have installed the **Latexsuit** plugin. There you can define your own snippet.

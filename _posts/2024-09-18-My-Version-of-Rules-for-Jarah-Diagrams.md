These rules are currently being used by myself and no one else, it is by no means standard or widely accepted. I find it extremely fun to play with those rules and diagrams.

# Rules for $H_ {3}^{(-)}$

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="/img/kink/H3Rules.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="width: 80%;" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Rules for various components of $H_3$. I regard them as vertices. The meaning of graphical elements are explain later.
</div>


# Rules for $H_ {4}^{(-)}$

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="/img/kink/H4Rules.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="width: 80%;" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Rules for various components of $H_4$. 
</div>


# Feynman-like Rules in General


# An example

```python
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="/img/kink/example.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="width: 80%;" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Here is an example of how to calculate $H_3^{(-3)}\lvert\Omega\rangle_1^{(3)}$.

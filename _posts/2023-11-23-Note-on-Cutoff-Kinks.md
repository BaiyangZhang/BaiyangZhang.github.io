Let $H'$ be the regularized Hamiltonian in the Kink sector, $H$ be that in the vacuum sector. Then $D_ {f}$ is the Morphism that maps from $H'$ to $H$. It should be invertible since there is no loss of information in the process, namely there should exist another map from $H$ to $H'$. Regard different sectors as objects in a category, this category is defined by a (classical) Lagrangian with a quantization functor (maybe), together with a lattice, or equivalently a momentum cutoff $\Lambda$. The map from $H$ to $H'$ is given by
$$
\boxed { 
H' = \mathcal{D}_ {f}^{\dagger} H \mathcal{D}_ {f},
}
$$
where $\mathcal{D}_ {f}$ is the shift operator defined by a function $f$, which usually corresponds to certain classical solitonic solutions.

**Comment 1:** Emergent dimensions is a corner-stone of large-N volume independence/Eguchi Kawai reduction idea. They have been understood since the early 80s at the perturbative level. See the TEK works of Gonzalez-Arroyo and Okawa 82, at the perturbative level, also Gross-Kitazawa who calculated beta function by using color-momentum transmutation idea. It is unacceptable not to refer to relevant works from the large-N volume independence/Eguchi-Kawai reduction literature. "The color indices can be thought of as discrete coordinates on an emergent "color space‚Äù[25]". This sentence is disrespect to old/new Eguchi-Kawai literature, which can generate all d- dimensions, including d=4, not just one. I urge the authors to familiarize themselves with this literature and refer to it properly. The new feature of your Ref. [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01902) is an non-perturbative emergence of a compact dimension from the spectrum of N = 1 SYM on $\mathbb{R}^{3}\times \mathbb{S}^{1}$.

**Response:** The authors thank the referee for his useful and informative comments. We agree that the progress on TEK model

The relation between emergent dimension and large-N volume independence? 

Large-$N$ volume independence allows for significant simplification of the dynamics of gauge theories.  

1) The concept of large-N volume independence was first studied in detail in the **1980s**, notably in the works of **Eguchi and Kawai (1982)**, and **Gonzalez-Arroyo and Okawa (1982)**, who showed that in the large-N limit, certain types of gauge theories exhibit volume independence. They were able to demonstrate that in the appropriate limit, a large-N gauge theory on a finite volume behaves in the same way as the same theory in infinite volume.
2) In this context, **color-momentum transmutation** (discovered in the works of **Gross and Kitazawa**) is a technique that helps explain how the large-N limit can reduce the effective number of degrees of freedom by converting color degrees of freedom into momentum space degrees of freedom, further simplifying the system.

**Question 1:** 

Emergent dimensions is a corner-stone of large-N volume independence/Eguchi Kawai reduction idea. They have been understood since the early 80s at the perturbative level. See the TEK works of Gonzalez-Arroyo and Okawa 82, at the perturbative level, also Gross-Kitazawa who calculated beta function by using color-momentum transmutation idea. It is unacceptable not to refer to relevant works from the large-N volume independence/ Eguchi-Kawai reduction literature. "The color indices can be thought of as discrete coordinates on an emergent "color space‚Äù[25]". This sentence is disrespect to old/new Eguchi-Kawai literature, which can generate all d- dimensions, in cluding d=4, not just one. I urge the authors to familiarize themselves with this literature and refer to it properly. The new feature of your Ref. [5] is an non-perturbative emergence of a compact dimension from the spectrum of N = 1 SYM on $\mathbb{R}^{3}\times \mathbb{S}^{1}$.

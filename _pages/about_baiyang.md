As a researcher specializing in theoretical physics and an incorrigible liberal, I am committed to a lifelong pursuit of academic exploration. The mysteries of the universe, encompassing both the laws of the natural world and the evolution of human society, deeply fascinate me. Physics and mathematics serve as my tools in the quest for truth, while friends are indispensable companions on my life journey. In my leisure time, I enjoy engaging in discussions about history and politics with friends and delving into the realms of natural philosophy and humanistic philosophy.

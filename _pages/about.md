As a researcher specializing in theoretical physics, I am committed to a lifelong pursuit of academic exploration. The mysteries of the universe, encompassing both the laws of the natural world and the evolution of human society, deeply fascinate me. Physics and mathematics serve as my tools in the quest for truth, while friends are indispensable companions on my life journey. 

My interests span a variety of domains, I love diving into history, especially China's modern twists and turns and the brainy bits of European and American thought. Political philosophy -- all the way from Hobbes to Chomsky -- gets me thinking, and classical music really soothe my soul. I'm all about the good eats and have a soft spot for those hazy double IPAs. Architecture's my jam too, give me those old-world vibes of Renaissance and Gothic styles. Keeping fit and hitting the trails are my go-to, and there's nothing like exploring the world on a good hike. However, nothing brings me greater joy and contentment than spending quality time with my loved ones. The Universe has as many different centers as there are living beings in it, and for me that center is comprised of my loved ones.

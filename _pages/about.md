As a researcher specializing in theoretical physics, I am committed to a lifelong pursuit of academic exploration. The mysteries of the universe, encompassing both the laws of the natural world and the evolution of human society, deeply fascinate me. Physics and mathematics serve as my tools in the quest for truth, while friends are indispensable companions on my life journey. 

My interests span a variety of domains, encompassing history—particularly modern Chinese history and the intellectual history of Europe and America—political philosophy, classical music, and piano performance. I am also a connoisseur of fine cuisine and have a particular fondness for hazy IPA beers. Additionally, my aesthetic inclinations draw me towards architecture, especially the Renaissance and Gothic styles, as well as contemporary politics. In terms of physical activities, I prioritize fitness and have a special affinity for hiking. Traveling, especially hiking in distant lands, is another passion of mine. However, nothing brings me greater joy and contentment than spending quality time with my loved ones.

```python
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="/img/kink/movingWall.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="width: 80%;" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="/img/Rosa.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

```

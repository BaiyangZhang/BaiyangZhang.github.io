The Hamiltonian density in Schrodinger picture reads

$$
\hat{\mathcal{H}}^{0}(\vec{x}) = \frac{1}{2}\pi^{2}(\vec{x})+\frac{1}{2} (\partial_ {i}\phi)^{2} - \frac{m_ {0}^{2}}{4} \phi^{2}(\vec{x}) + \frac{g_ {0}^{2}}{4} \phi^{4}(\vec{x}) + A, 
$$

where the c-number $A$ is a counterterm. The field and canonical momentum are expanded in plane waves,

$$
\begin{align*}
\phi(\vec{x})&= \int \frac{d^{3}\vec{p}}{(2\pi)^{3}} \, e^{ -i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} } \left( A_ {\vec{p}}^{\ddagger}+\frac{A_ {-\vec{p}}}{2\omega_ {\vec{p}}} \right),  \\
\pi(\vec{x})&= i \int \frac{d^{3}\vec{p}}{(2\pi)^{3}} \,  e^{ -i\vec{p}\cdot \vec{x} } \left( \omega_ {\vec{p}} A_ {\vec{p}}^{\ddagger}-\frac{A_ {-\vec{p}}}{2} \right) .
\end{align*}
$$


where $\omega_ {p}= \sqrt{ m^{2}+\vec{p}^{2}}$ and $A, A^{\ddagger}$ satisfy the canonical commutation relation. The renormalized parameters are $m^{2}=m_ {0}^{2} + \delta m^{2}$, $g = g_ 0 + \delta g$, and $A=\sum_ {i=0}^{\infty}A_ {i}$. The physical vacuum $\left\lvert \Psi \right\rangle=\sum_ {i=0}^{\infty}\left\lvert \Psi \right\rangle_ {i}$ is also expanded in $g$, where $\left\lvert \Psi \right\rangle_ {i}\sim \mathcal{O}(g^{i})$.

They have been understood since the early 80s at the perturbative level. See the TEK works of Gonzalez-Arroyo and Okawa 82, at the perturbative level, also Gross-Kitazawa who calculated beta function by using color-momentum transmutation idea. It is unacceptable not to refer to relevant works from the large-N volume independence/Eguchi-Kawai reduction literature. “The color indices can be thought of as discrete coordinates on an emergent “color space”[25]”. This sentence is disrespect to old/new Eguchi-Kawai literature, which can generate all d-dimensions, including $d=4$, not just one. I urge the authors to familiarize themselves with this literature and refer to it properly. The new feature of your Ref. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01902" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">5</a> is an non-perturbative emergence of a compact dimension from the spectrum of N = 1 SYM on $\mathbb{R}^{3}\times \mathbb{S}^{1}$.</p> <p><strong>Response:</strong> We thank the referee for his/her valuable comment on our manuscript. The referee suggested that we familiarize ourselves with and cite works on the (Quenched-, Twisted-) Eguchi-Kawai model and concepts such as color-momentum transmutation. We have carefully reviewed these papers and incorporated the relevant references and modifications into the manuscript. Please see our detailed response below.</p> <p><strong>Changes made in response to comment:</strong></p> <ol> <li> <p>Added the following content in Introduction, starting from line 4 in section 1: Since the 1980s, volume independence or the (twisted) reduction mechanism at large $N$ in decompactified lattice gauge theory have been extensively studied [2-6]. It is now well understood that in a $d$-dimensional lattice gauge theory, as long as the $U(1)^{d}$ center symmetry remains unbroken, the standard Wilson lattice theory reduces to the Eguchi-Kawai (EK) model, defined on a single hypercube with specific boundary conditions, and the loop equations become volume-independent. Moreover, the effective action can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of the link matrices, which resemble lattice momenta. This resemblance underpins the key concept of color-momentum transmutation and the quenched momentum prescription, which apply to both lattice and continuum theories, see [7,8] and references therein. Also, see [9] for a similar resemblance between group indices and spatial lattice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deleted the sentence “The color indices can be thought of as discrete coordinates on an emergent “color space”[25]”. Since the authors consider reference [25] (now Ref. [9] in the revised version) to be relevant, we have moved its citation to the beginning of the introduction.</p> </li> </ol> <hr> <p><strong>Comment 2:</strong> The non-trivial spectrum of $\mathcal{N} = 1$ SYM which leads to the result of Ref.[5] is derived in the work of Unsal Phys.Rev.D80:065001,2009, arXiv:0709.3269[hep-th]. Almost all interesting non-perturbative dynamics of the $N = 1$ SYM theory, including mass spectrum</p> \[m_ {k}^{2}\sim e^{ -2S_ {m} } \sin^{4}(\pi k / N)\] <p>which lead to Lifschitz scaling (hence, the result of Ref.[5]) is derived in this work. Yet, you dismiss it. Magnetic bions that you refer to [20] are introduced therein as well.</p> <p><strong>Response:</strong> The referee is absolutely right to point out that the foundational nonperturbative dynamics of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM theory was presented in Phys.Rev.D80:065001. We sincerely apologize for omitting this important reference in the original draft. In accordance with the referee’s suggestion, we have made the following revisions:</p> <p><strong>Change made in response to comment:</strong></p> <ol> <li>In Section 1, paragraph 3, we have rewritten the second sentence to incorporate the key reference (Mithat Unsal. Magnetic bion condensation: A new mechanism of confinement and mass gap in four dimensions) provided by the referee (now cited as Ref. [14]). The revised sentence reads: “…It was observed that, along with some other examples, $4d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ has a large N limit with this property, see Ref. [13-15].”</li> <li>At the beginning of page 5, where magnetic bions are mentioned, we have added the same reference suggested by the referee. The revised sentence now reads: “… small mass (exponentially small compared to $m_ {W}$ ) due to the proliferation of certain non-BPS magnetically-charged finite-action field configurations called magnetic bions [14,31].”</li> </ol> <hr> <p><strong>Comment 3:</strong> GPY is a method for calculating holonomy potential. However, neither GPY, nor non-susy QCD community ever considered fermions with periodic boundary conditions. Periodic boundary conditions for fermions is not a technical detail here, it is a conceptual change of perspective due to its nonthermal nature. On the flip side, you can say, susy community considered this boundary condition. True as in your [14], [15]. But they never considered any susy non-protected observables. They only consider few operators protected by susy, but not the general dynamics. This perspective shift occurred in Unsal Phys.Rev.D80:065001,2009, arXiv:0709.3269 [hep-th]. Your result based on Lifschitz theory is a consequence of this perspective change and you do not even credit this work. As far as I know, your equation 2.7 was first derived in the work of Unsal-Yaffe in e-Print: 1006.2101 [hep-th] 10.1007/JHEP08(2010)030, not in GPY.</p> <p><strong>Response:</strong> The referee is absolutely correct in emphasizing that the transition from a thermal to a nonthermal circle is not merely a mathematical detail but also requires a conceptual shift. Additionally, it is inappropriate to refer to the effective potential as the ‘GPY potential’ in this context. We have revised the relevant sentence to properly acknowledge the significance of reference Phys. Rev. D80:065001 (2009). Furthermore, our Eq. (2.7) was indeed first derived in Ref. 1006.2101 [hep-th], 10.1007/JHEP08(2010)030, specifically in Section 5. We sincerely apologize for this oversight and have now included the appropriate reference in the revised version.</p> <p><strong>Change made in response to comment:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Right above Eq.(2.7), we have deleted the sentence “Generically, loops of gauge-charged bosons and fermions generate a “GPY” effective potential for Polyakov loops.” and replaced it with the following: “The “GPY” effective action, incorporating both perturbative and nonperturbative contributions on a thermal circle, was first derived in the seminal work [32]. Transitioning from a thermal to a nonthermal circle requires a shift in perspective, the effective potential in the latter case was given in [14]. The effective potential for $n_f$ flavors of adjoint fermions was subsequently given in [6].”</li> <li>Since it is inappropriate to call the subsequent effective potential $V_ {\text{GPY}}$, we have changed it to $V_ {\text{eff}}(\Omega)$ throughout the manuscript, also we have replace “GPY potential” with “effective potential”.</li> </ol> <hr> <p><strong>Comment 4:</strong> Following your equation (2.9), it says “The crucial point is that nonperturbative effects generate contributions to the holonomy effective potential which are proportional to $m^{0}$ and $m^{1}$ [14, 22].” Neither [14], nor [22] writes down a holonomy potential. Especially, [22] has nothing to do with it, in fact, it has nothing to do with your paper! From the superpotential in [14], one can derive a bosonic potential. But [14] does not actually do that. Explicit form of these non-perturbative effects are considered in your reference [23].</p> <p><strong>Response:</strong> We appreciate the referee’s careful reading of our manuscript and for pointing out the incorrect citations. The referee is absolutely right that Ref. Old reference [14,22] should not have been cited in this context. Moreover, while Ref. [14] does contain the relevant superpotential, it does not explicitly derive the holonomy potential. The explicit form of the nonperturbative contributions to the holonomy potential is indeed addressed in old Ref. [23], which is Ref. [33] in the revised version. In light of this, we have corrected the citation and revised the corresponding sentence to accurately reflect the sources of these contributions.</p> <p><strong>Change made in response to comment:</strong> The sentence following Eq. (2.9) has been revised as follows: “The crucial point is that nonperturbative effects generate contributions to the holonomy effective potential that are proportional to $m^0$ and $m^1$ [33].” Here, we have removed the incorrect old references [14] and [22] and retained only Ref. [33] ([23] in the old version), which properly addresses the explicit form of these effects.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Comment 5:</strong> Since the whole work take place in an alternative large-N limit, there should be a reference to this kind of large-N limits in the literature. Abelian large-N limit first appeared in M. R. Douglas and S. H. Shenker, Dynamics of SU(N) supersymmetric gauge theory, Nucl. Phys. B 447 (1995) 271, hep-th/9503163. Its relevance on $R^{3}\times S^{1}$ first appears in M. Unsal and L. G. Yaffe, Center-stabilized Yang-Mills theory: confinement and large N volume independence, Phys. Rev. D 78 (2008) 065035, arXiv:0803.0344 [hep-th].</p> <p><strong>Response:</strong> We thank the referee for pointing out the importance of referencing the relevant literature on alternative large-$N$ limits. The referee is absolutely correct that the Abelian large-NN limit was first introduced in M. R. Douglas and S. H. Shenker, Nucl. Phys. B 447 (1995) 271, hep-th/9503163, and that its relevance in the context of $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ was first discussed in M. Ünsal and L. G. Yaffe, Phys. Rev. D 78 (2008) 065035, arXiv:0803.0344 [hep-th]. In response to the referee’s comment, we have added these references at appropriate places in the manuscript to properly acknowledge their contributions.</p> <p><strong>Change made in response to comment:</strong></p> <ol> <li>The important reference by M. Unsal and L. G. Yaffe, Phys. Rev. D 78 (2008) 065035, arXiv:0803.0344 was added at the very beginning of section 1, paragraph 4: “But there is another interesting way to take the large N limit. Suppose that we place SYM theory on the manifold $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$, where $S^{1}$ has a circumference $L$, and we assume that the fermions have periodic boundary conditions on $S^{1}$. The abelian large $N$ limit on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ was first introduced in Ref [20]. …” where [20] refers to Phys. Rev. D 78 (2008) 065035.</li> <li>Added the reference by M. R. Douglas and S. H. Shenker, Nucl. Phys. B 447 (1995) 271, hep-th/9503163 to section 1, paragraph 3, line 4, where large N behavior was discussed; “… It was observed that, along with some other examples, 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ super-Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ has a large $N$ limit with this property, see Ref. [13–15]. “ where Ref. [13] is the paper mentioned by the referee.</li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Baiyang 张柏阳 Zhang.
